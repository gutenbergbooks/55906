    <h2>
      THE EARL OF CHATHAM. (1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, October 1844.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ore <span
      class="pagenum">1</span><a name="link1" id="link1"></a>than ten years ago
      we commenced a sketch of the political life of the great Lord Chatham. We
      then stopped at the death of George the Second, with the intention of
      speedily resuming our task. Circumstances, which it would be tedious to
      explain, long prevented us from carrying this intention into effect. Nor
      can we regret the delay. For the materials which were within our reach in
      1834 were scanty and unsatisfactory, when compared with those which we at
      present possess. Even now, though we have had access to some valuable
      sources of information which have not yet been opened to the public, we
      cannot but feel that the history of the first ten years of the reign of
      George the Third is but imperfectly known to us. Nevertheless, we are
      inclined to think that we are in a condition to lay before our readers a
      narrative neither uninstructive nor uninteresting. We therefore return
      with pleasure to our long interrupted labour.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">2</span><a name="link2" id="link2"></a>the idol of
      England, the terror of France, the admiration of the whole civilised
      world. The wind, from whatever quarter it blew, carried to England tidings
      of battles won, fortresses taken, provinces added to the empire. At home,
      factions had sunk into a lethargy, such as had never been known since the
      great religious schism of the sixteenth century had roused the public mind
      from repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order that the events which we have to relate may be clearly
      understood, it may be desirable that we should advert to the causes which
      had for a time suspended the animation of both the great English parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, rejecting all that is merely accidental, we look at the essential
      characteristics of the Whig and the Tory, we may consider each of them as
      the representative of a great principle, essential to the welfare of
      nations. One is, in an especial manner, the guardian of liberty, and the
      other, of order. One is the moving power, and the other the steadying
      power of the state. One is the sail, without which society would make no
      progress, the other the ballast, without which there would be small safety
      in a tempest. But, during the forty-six years which followed the accession
      of the House of Hanover, these distinctive peculiarities seemed to be
      effaced. The Whig conceived that he could not better serve the cause of
      civil and religious freedom than by strenuously supporting the Protestant
      dynasty. The Tory conceived that he could not better prove his hatred of
      revolutions than by attacking a government to which a revolution had given
      birth. Both came by degrees to attach more importance to the means than to
      the end. Both were thrown into unnatural situations; and both, like
      animals transported to an uncongenial <span class="pagenum">3</span><a
      name="link3" id="link3"></a>climate, languished and degenerated. The Tory,
      removed from the sunshine of the court, was as a camel in the snows of
      Lapland. The Whig, basking in the rays of royal favour, was as a reindeer
      in the sands of Arabia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dante tells us that he saw, in Maleholge, a strange encounter between a
      human form and a serpent. The enemies, after cruel wounds inflicted, stood
      for a time glaring on each other. A great cloud surrounded them, and then
      a wonderful metamorphosis began. Each creature was transfigured into the
      likeness of its antagonist. The serpent&rsquo;s tail divided itself into two
      legs; the man&rsquo;s legs intertwined themselves into a tail. The body of the
      serpent put forth arms; the arms of the man shrank into his body. At
      length the serpent stood up a man, and spake; the man sank down a serpent,
      and glided hissing away. Something like this was the transformation which,
      during the reign of George the First, befell the two English parties. Each
      gradually took the shape and colour of its foe, till at length the Tory
      rose up erect the zealot of freedom, and the Whig crawled and licked the
      dust at the feet of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that, when these degenerate politicians discussed questions
      merely speculative, and, above all, when they discussed questions relating
      to the conduct of their own grandfathers, they still seemed to differ as
      their grandfathers had differed. The Whig, who, during three Parliaments,
      had never given one vote against the court, and who was ready to sell his
      soul for the Comptroller&rsquo;s staff or for the Great Wardrobe, still
      professed to draw his political doctrines from Locke and Milton, still
      worshipped the memory of Pym and Hampden, and would still, on the
      thirtieth of January, <span class="pagenum">4</span><a name="link4"
       id="link4"></a>take his class, first to the man in the mask, and then to
      the man who would do it without a mask. The Tory, on the other hand, while
      he reviled the mild and temperate Walpole as a deadly enemy of liberty,
      could see nothing to reprobate in the iron tyranny of Strafford and Land.
      But, whatever judgment the Whig or the Tory of that age might pronounce on
      transactions long past, there can be no doubt that, as respected the
      practical questions then pending, the Tory was a reformer, and indeed an
      intemperate and indiscreet reformer, while the Whig; was conservative even
      to bigotry. We have ourselves, seen similar effects produced in a
      neighbouring country by similar causes. Who would have believed, fifteen
      years ago, that M. Guizot and M. Villemain would have to defend property
      and social order against the attacks of such enemies as M. Genoude and M.
      de La Roche Jaquelin?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the successors of the old Cavaliers had turned demagogues; the
      successors of the old Roundheads had turned courtiers. Yet was it long
      before their mutual animosity began to abate; for it is the nature of
      parties to retain their original enmities far more firmly than their
      original principles. During many years, a generation of Whigs, whom Sidney
      would have spurned as slaves, continued to wage deadly war with a
      generation of Tories whom Jeffreys would have hanged for Republicans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the whole reign of George the First, and through nearly half of
      the reign of George the Second, a Tory was regarded as an enemy of the
      reigning house, and was excluded from all the favours of the crown. Though
      most of the country gentlemen were Tories, none but Whigs were created
      peers and baronets. <span class="pagenum">5</span><a name="link5"
       id="link5"></a>Though most of the clergy were Tories, none but Whigs were
      appointed deans and bishops. In every county, opulent and well descended
      Tory squires complained that their names were left out of the commission
      of the peace, while men of small estate and mean birth, who were for
      toleration and excise, septennial parliaments and standing armies,
      presided at quarter sessions, and became deputy lieutenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees some approaches were made towards a reconciliation. While
      Walpole was at the head of affairs, enmity to his power induced a large
      and powerful body of Whigs, headed by the heir apparent of the throne, to
      make an alliance with the Tories, and a truce even with the Jacobites.
      After Sir Robert&rsquo;s fall, the ban which lay on the Tory party was taken
      off. The chief places in the administration continued to be filled by
      Whigs, and, indeed, could scarcely have been filled otherwise; for the
      Tory nobility and gentry, though strong in numbers and in property, had
      among them scarcely a single man distinguished by talents, either for
      business or for debate. A few of them, however, were admitted to
      subordinate offices; and this indulgence produced a softening effect on
      the temper of the whole body. The first levee of George the Second after
      Walpole&rsquo;s resignation was a remarkable spectacle. Mingled with the
      constant supporters of the House of Brunswick, with the Russells, the
      Cavendishes, and the Pelhams, appeared a crowd of faces utterly unknown to
      the pages and gentlemen ushers, lords of rural manors, whose ale and
      fox-hounds were renowned in the neighbourhood of the Mendip hills, or
      round the Wrekin, but who had never crossed the threshold of the palace
      since the days when Oxford, with the white staff in his hand, stood behind
      Queen Anne. <span class="pagenum">6</span><a name="link6" id="link6"></a>During
      the eighteen years which followed this clay, both factions were gradually
      sinking deeper and deeper into repose. The apathy of the public mind is
      partly to be ascribed to the unjust violence with which the administration
      of Walpole had been assailed. In the body politic, as in the natural body,
      morbid languor generally succeeds morbid excitement. The people had been
      maddened by sophistry, by calumny, by rhetoric, by stimulants applied to
      the national pride. In the fulness of bread, they had raved as if famine
      had been in the land. While enjoying such a measure of civil and religious
      freedom as, till then, no great society had ever known, they had cried out
      for a Timoleon or a Brutus to stab their oppressor to the heart. They were
      in this frame of mind when the change of administration took place; and
      they soon found that there was to be no change whatever in the system of
      government. The natural consequences followed. To frantic zeal succeeded
      sullen indifference. The cant of patriotism had not merely ceased to charm
      the public ear, but had become as nauseous as the cant of Puritanism after
      the downfall of the Rump. The hot fit was over: the cold fit had begun:
      and it was long before seditious arts, or even real grievances, could
      bring back the fiery paroxysm which had run its course and reached its
      termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two attempts were made to disturb this tranquillity. The banished heir of
      the House of Stewart headed a rebellion; the discontented heir of the
      House of Brunswick headed an opposition. Both the rebellion and the
      opposition came to nothing. The battle of Culloden annihilated the
      Jacobite party. The death of Prince Frederic dissolved the faction which,
      under his guidance, had feebly striven to annoy his father&rsquo;s government.
      <span class="pagenum">7</span><a name="link7" id="link7"></a>His chief
      followers hastened to make their peace with the ministry; and the
      political torpor became complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years after the death of Prince Frederic, the public mind was for a
      time violently excited. But this excitement had nothing to do with the old
      disputes between Whigs and Tories. England was at war with France. The war
      had been feebly conducted. Minorca had been torn from us. Our fleet had
      retired before the white flag of the House of Bourbon. A bitter sense of
      humiliation, new to the proudest and bravest of nations, superseded every
      other feeling. The cry of all the counties and great towns of the realm
      was for a government which would retrieve the honour of the English arms.
      The two most powerful men in the country were the Duke of Newcastle and
      Pitt. Alternate victories and defeats had made them sensible that neither
      of them could stand alone. The interest of the state, and the interest of
      their own ambition, impelled them to coalesce. By their coalition was
      formed the ministry which was in power when George the Third ascended the
      throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more carefully the structure of this celebrated ministry is examined,
      the more shall we see reason to marvel at the skill or the luck which had
      combined in one harmonious whole such various and, as it seemed,
      incompatible elements of force. The influence which is derived from
      stainless integrity, the influence which is derived from the vilest arts
      of corruption, the strength of aristocratical connection, the strength of
      democratical enthusiasm, all these things were for the first time found
      together. Newcastle brought to the coalition a vast mass of power, which
      had descended to him from Walpole and Pelham. The public offices, the
      church, <span class="pagenum">8</span><a name="link8" id="link8"></a>the
      courts of law, the army, the navy, the diplomatic service, swarmed with
      his creatures. The boroughs, which long afterwards made up the memorable
      schedules A and B, were represented by his nominees. The great Whig
      families, which, during several generations, had been trained in the
      discipline of party warfare, and were accustomed to stand together in a
      firm phalanx, acknowledged him as their captain. Pitt, on the other hand,
      had what Newcastle wanted, an eloquence which stirred the passions and
      charmed the imagination, a high reputation for purity, and the confidence
      and ardent love of millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partition which the two ministers made of the powers of government was
      singularly happy. Each occupied a province for which he was well
      qualified; and neither had any inclination to intrude himself into the
      province of the other. Newcastle took the treasury, the civil and
      ecclesiastical patronage, and the disposal of that part of the secret
      service money which was then employed in bribing members of Parliament.
      Pitt was Secretary of State, with the direction of the war and of foreign
      affairs. Thus the filth of all the noisome and pestilential sewers of
      government was poured into one channel. Through the other passed only what
      was bright and stainless. Mean and selfish politicians, pining for
      commissionerships, gold sticks, and ribands, flocked to the great house at
      the corner of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. There, at every levee, appeared
      eighteen or twenty pair of lawn sleeves; for there was not, it was said, a
      single Prelate who had not owed either his first elevation or some
      subsequent translation to Newcastle. There appeared those members of the
      House of Commons in whose silent votes the main strength of the government
      lay. One wanted a <span class="pagenum">9</span><a name="link9" id="link9"></a>place
      in the excise for his butler. Another came about a prebend for his son. A
      third whispered that he had always stood by his Grace and the Protestant
      succession; that his last election had been very expensive; that
      potwallopers had now no conscience; that he had been forced to take up
      money on mortgage; and that he hardly knew where to turn for five hundred
      pounds. The Duke pressed all their hands, passed his arms round all their
      shoulders, patted all their backs, and sent away some with wages, and some
      with promises. From this traffic Pitt stood haughtily aloof. Not only was
      he himself incorruptible, but he shrank from the loathsome drudgery of
      corrupting others. He had not, however, been twenty years in Parliament,
      and ten in office, without discovering how the government was carried on.
      He was perfectly aware that bribery was practised on a large scale by his
      colleagues. Hating the practice, yet despairing of putting it down, and
      doubting whether, in those times, any ministry could stand without it, he
      determined to be blind to it. He would see nothing, know nothing, believe
      nothing. People who came to talk to him about shares in lucrative
      contracts, or about the means of securing a Cornish corporation, were soon
      put out of countenance by his arrogant humility. They did him too much
      honour. Such matters were beyond his capacity. It was true that his poor
      advice about expeditions and treaties was listened to with indulgence by a
      gracious sovereign. If the question were, who should command in North
      America, or who should be ambassador at Berlin, his colleagues would
      probably condescend to take his opinion. But he had not the smallest
      influence with the Secretary of the Treasury, and could not venture to ask
      even for a tidewaiter&rsquo;s place. <span class="pagenum">10</span><a
      name="link10" id="link10"></a>It may be doubted whether he did not owe as
      much of his popularity to his ostentatious purity as to his eloquence, or
      to his talents for the administration of war. It was every where said with
      delight and admiration that the great Commoner, without any advantages of
      birth or fortune, had, in spite of the dislike of the Court and of the
      aristocracy, made himself the first, man in England, and made England the
      first country in the world; that his name was mentioned with awe in every
      palace from Lisbon to Moscow; that his trophies were in all the four
      quarters of the globe; yet that he was still plain William Pitt, without
      title or riband, without pension or sinecure place. Whenever he should
      retire, after saving the state, he must sell his coach horses and his
      silver candlesticks. Widely as the taint of corruption had spread, his
      hands were clean. They had never received, they had never given, the price
      of infamy. Thus the coalition gathered to itself support from all the high
      and all the low parts of human nature, and was strong with the whole
      united strength of virtue and of Mammon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt and Newcastle were co-ordinate chief ministers. The subordinate
      places had been filled on the principle of including in the government
      every party and shade of party, the avowed Jacobites alone excepted, nay,
      every public man who, from his abilities or from his situation, seemed
      likely to be either useful in office or formidable in opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Whigs, according to what was then considered as their prescriptive
      right, held by far the largest share of power. The main support of the
      administration was what may be called the great Whig connection, a
      connection which, during near half a century, had <span class="pagenum">11</span><a
      name="link11" id="link11"></a>generally had the chief sway in the country,
      and which derived an immense authority from rank, wealth, borough
      interest, and firm union. To this connection, of which Newcastle was the
      head, belonged the houses of Cavendish, Lennox, Fitzroy, Bentinck,
      Manners, Conway, Wentworth, and many others of high note.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two other powerful Whig connections, either of which might have
      been a nucleus for a strong opposition. But room had been found in the
      government for both. They were known as the Grenvilles and the Bedfords.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the Grenvilles was Richard Earl Temple. His talents for
      administration and debate were of no high order. But his great
      possessions, his turbulent and unscrupulous character, his restless
      activity, and his skill in the most ignoble tactics of faction, made him
      one of the most formidable enemies that a ministry could have. He was
      keeper of the privy seal. His brother George was treasurer of the navy.
      They were supposed to be on terms of close friendship with Pitt, who had
      married their sister, and was the most uxorious of husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bedfords, or, as they were called by their enemies, the Bloomsbury
      gang, professed to be led by John Duke of Bedford, but in truth led him
      wherever they chose, and very often led him where he never would have gone
      of his own accord. He had many good qualities of head and heart, and would
      have been certainly a respectable, and possibly a distinguished man, if he
      had been less under the influence of his friends, or more fortunate in
      choosing them. Some of them were indeed, to do them justice, men of parts.
      But here, we are afraid, eulogy must end. <span class="pagenum">12</span><a
      name="link12" id="link12"></a>Sandwich and Rigby were able debaters,
      pleasant boon companions, dexterous intriguers, masters of all the arts of
      jobbing and electioneering, and both in public and private life,
      shamelessly immoral. Weymouth had a natural eloquence, which sometimes
      astonished those who knew how little he owed to study. But he was indolent
      and dissolute, and had early impaired a fine estate with the dice box, and
      a fine constitution with the bottle. The wealth and power of the Duke, and
      the talents and audacity of some of his retainers, might have seriously
      annoyed the strongest ministry. But his assistance had been secured. He
      was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; Rigby was his secretary; and the whole
      party dutifully supported the measures of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men had, a short time before, been thought likely to contest with Pitt
      the lead of the House of Commons, William Murray and Henry Fox. But Murray
      had been removed to the Lords, and was Chief Justice of the Kings Bench.
      Fox was indeed still in the Commons: but means had been found to secure,
      if not his strenuous support, at least his silent acquiescence. He was a
      poor man; he was a doting father. The office of Paymaster-General durum an
      expensive war was, in that age, perhaps the most lucrative situation in
      the gift of the government. This office was bestowed on Fox. The prospect
      of making a noble fortune in a few years, and of providing amply for his
      darling boy Charles, was irresistibly tempting. To hold a subordinate
      place, however profitable, after having led the House of Commons, and
      having been intrusted with the business of forming a ministry, was indeed
      a great descent. But a punctilious sense of personal dignity was no part
      of the character of Henry Fox. <span class="pagenum">13</span><a
      name="link13" id="link13"></a>We have not time to enumerate all the other
      men of weight who were, by some tie or other, attached to the government.
      We may mention Hardwicke, reputed the first lawyer of the age; Legge,
      reputed the first financier of the age; the acute and ready Oswald; the
      bold and humorous Nugent; Charles Townshend, the most brilliant and
      versatile of mankind; Elliot, Barrington, North, Pratt. Indeed, as far as
      we recollect, there were in the whole House of Commons only two men of
      distinguished abilities who were not connected with the government; and
      those two men stood so low in public estimation, that the only service
      which they could have rendered to any government would have been to oppose
      it. We speak of Lord George Sackville and Bubb Dodington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though most of the official men, and all the members of the cabinet, were
      reputed Whigs, the Tories were by no means excluded from employment. Pitt
      had gratified many of them with commands in the militia, which increased
      both their income and their importance in their own counties; and they
      were therefore in better humour than at any time since the death of Anne.
      Some of the party still continued to grumble over their punch at the Cocoa
      Tree; but in the House of Commons not a single one of the malecontents
      durst lift his eyes above the buckle of Pitt&rsquo;s shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus there was absolutely no opposition. Nay, there was no sign from which
      it could be guessed in what quarter opposition was likely to arise.
      Several years passed during which Parliament seemed to have abdicated its
      chief functions. The Journals of the House of Commons, during four
      sessions, contain no trace of a division on a party question. The
      supplies, <span class="pagenum">14</span><a name="link14" id="link14"></a>though
      beyond precedent great, were voted without discussion. The most animated
      debates of that period were on road bills and inclosure bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old King was content; and it mattered little whether he were content
      or not. It would have been impossible for him to emancipate himself from a
      ministry so powerful, even if he had been inclined to do so. But he had no
      such inclination. He had once, indeed, been strongly prejudiced against
      Pitt, and had repeatedly been ill used by Newcastle; but the vigour and
      success with which the war had been waged in Germany, and the smoothness
      with which all public business was carried on, had produced a favourable
      change in the royal mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the posture of affairs when, on the twenty-fifth of October,
      1760, George the Second suddenly died, and George the Third, then
      twenty-two years old, became King. The situation of George the Third
      differed widely from that of his grandfather and that of his
      greatgrandfather. Many years had elapsed since a sovereign of England had
      been an object of affection to any part of his people. The first two Kings
      of the House of Hanover had neither those hereditary rights which have
      often supplied the defect of merit, nor those personal qualities which
      have often supplied the defect of title. A prince may be popular with
      little virtue or capacity, if he reigns by birthright derived from a long
      line of illustrious predecessors. An usurper may be popular, if his genius
      has saved or aggrandised the nation which he governs. Perhaps no rulers
      have in our time had a stronger hold on the affection of subjects than the
      Emperor Francis, and his son-inlaw the Emperor Napoleon. But imagine a
      ruler with no better title than Napoleon, and no better understanding
      <span class="pagenum">15</span><a name="link15" id="link15"></a>than
      Francis. Richard Cromwell was such a ruler; and, as soon as an arm was
      lifted up against him, he fell without a struggle, amidst universal
      derision. George the First and George the Second were in a situation which
      bore some resemblance to that of Richard Cromwell. They were saved from
      the fate of Richard Cromwell by the strenuous and able exertions of the
      Whig party, and by the general conviction that the nation had no choice
      but between the House of Brunswick and popery. But by no class were the
      Guelphs regarded with that devoted affection, of which Charles the First,
      Charles the Second, and James the Second, in spite of the greatest faults,
      and in the midst of the greatest misfortunes, received innumerable proofs.
      Those Whigs who stood by the new dynasty so manfully with purse and sword
      did so on principles independent of, and indeed almost incompatible with,
      the sentiment of devoted loyalty. The moderate Tories regarded the foreign
      dynasty as a great evil, which must be endured for fear of a greater evil.
      In the eyes of the high Tories, the Elector was the most hateful of
      robbers and tyrants. The crown of another was on his head; the blood of
      the brave and loyal was on his hands. Thus, during many years, the Kings
      of England were objects of strong personal aversion to many of their
      subjects, and of strong personal attachment to none. They found, indeed,
      firm and cordial support against the pretender to their throne; but this
      support was given, not at all for their sake, but for the sake of a
      religious and political system which would have been endangered by their
      fall. This support, too, they were compelled to purchase by perpetually
      sacrificing their private inclinations to the party which had set them on
      the throne, and which maintained them there. <span class="pagenum">16</span><a
      name="link16" id="link16"></a>At the close of the reign of George the
      Second, the feeling of aversion with which the House of Brunswick had long
      been regarded by half the nation had died away: but no feeling of
      affection to that house had yet sprung up. There was little, indeed, in
      the old King&rsquo;s character to inspire esteem or tenderness. He was not our
      countryman. He never set foot on our soil till he was more than thirty
      years old. His speech betrayed his foreign origin and breeding. His love
      for his native land, though the most amiable part of his character, was
      not likely to endear him to his British subjects. He was never so happy as
      when he could exchange St. James&rsquo;s for Hernhansen. Year after year, our
      fleets were employed to convoy him to the Continent, and the interests of
      his kingdom were as nothing to him when compared with the interests of his
      Electorate. As to the rest, he had neither the qualities which make
      dulness respectable, nor the qualities which make libertinism attractive.
      He had been a bad son and a worse father, an unfaithful husband and an
      ungraceful lover. Not one magnanimous or humane action is recorded of him;
      but many instances of meanness, and of a harshness which, but for the
      strong constitutional restraints under which he was placed, might have
      made the misery of his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died; and at once a new world opened. The young King was a born
      Englishman. All his tastes and habits, good or bad, were English. No
      portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with. Even the
      remaining adherents of the House of Stuart could scarcely impute to him
      the guilt of usurpation. He was not responsible for the Revolution, for
      the Act of Settlement, for the suppression of the risings of 1715 and of
      1745. He was innocent of the blood <span class="pagenum">17</span><a
      name="link17" id="link17"></a>of Derwentwater and Kilmarnock, of Balmerino
      and Cameron. Born fifty years after the old line had been expelled, fourth
      in descent and third in succession of the Hanoverian dynasty, he might
      plead some show of hereditary right. His age, his appearance, and all that
      was known of his character, conciliated public favour. He was in the bloom
      of youth; his person and address were pleasing. Scandal imputed to him no
      vice; and flattery might, without any glaring absurdity, ascribe to him
      many princely virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not strange, therefore, that the sentiment of loyalty, a sentiment
      which had lately seemed to be as much out of date as the belief in witches
      or the practice of pilgrimage, should, from the day of his accession, have
      begun to revive. The Tories in particular, who had always been inclined to
      Kingworship, and who had long felt with pain the want of an idol before
      whom they could bow themselves down, were as joyful as the priests of
      Apis, when, after a long interval, they had found a new calf to adore. It
      was soon clear that George the Third was regarded by a portion of the
      nation with a very different feeling from that which his two predecessors
      had inspired. They had been merely First Magistrates, Doges, Stadtholders;
      he was emphatically a King, the anointed of heaven, the breath of his
      people&rsquo;s nostrils. The years of the widowhood and mourning of the Tory
      party were over. Dido had kept faith long enough to the cold ashes of a
      former lord; she had at last found a comforter, and recognised the
      vestigus of the old flame. The golden days of Harley would return. The
      Somersets, the Lees, and the Wyndhams would again surround the throne. The
      latitudinarian Prelates, who had not been ashamed to correspond with
      Doddridge and to <span class="pagenum">18</span><a name="link18"
       id="link18"></a>shake hands with Winston, would he succeeded by divines of
      the temper of South and Atterbury. The devotion which had been so signally
      shown to the House of Stuart, which had been proof against defeats,
      confiscations, and proscriptions, which perfidy, oppression, ingratitude,
      could not weary out, was now transferred entire to the House of Brunswick.
      If George the Third would but accept the homage of the Cavaliers and High
      Churchmen, he should be to them all that Charles the First and Charles the
      Second had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, whose accession was thus hailed by a great party long
      estranged from his house, had received from nature a strong will, a
      firmness of temper to which a harsher name might perhaps be given, and an
      understanding not, indeed, acute or enlarged, but such as qualified him to
      be a good man of business. But his character had not yet fully developed
      itself. He had been brought up in strict seclusion. The detractors of the
      Princess Dowager of Wales affirmed that she had kept her children from
      commerce with society, in order that she might hold an undivided empire
      over their minds. She gave a very different explanation of her conduct.
      She would gladly, she said, see her sons and daughters mix in the world,
      if they could do so without risk to their morals. But the profligacy of
      the people of quality alarmed her. The young men were all rakes; the young
      women made love, instead of waiting till it was made to them. She could
      not bear to expose those whom she loved best to the contaminating
      influence of such society. The moral advantages of the system of education
      which formed the Duke of York, the Duke of Cumberland, and the Queen of
      Denmark, may perhaps be questioned. George the Third was indeed no
      libertine; but he brought to the <span class="pagenum">19</span><a
      name="link19" id="link19"></a>throne a mind only half opened, and was for
      some time entirely under the influence of his mother and of his Groom of
      the Stole, John Stuart, Earl of Bute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Bute was scarcely known even by name, to the country which he
      was soon to govern. He had indeed, a short time after he came of age, been
      chosen to fill a vacancy, which, in the middle of a parliament, had taken
      place among the Scotch representative peers. He had disobliged the Whig
      ministers by giving some silent votes with the Tories, had consequently
      lost his seat at the next dissolution, and had never been reelected. Near
      twenty years had elapsed since he had borne any part in politics. He had
      passed some of those years at his seat, in one of the Hebrides, and from
      that retirement he had emerged as one of the household of Prince
      Frederick. Lord Bute, excluded from public life, had found out many ways
      of amusing his leisure. He was a tolerable actor in private theatricals,
      and was particularly successful in the part of Lothario. A handsome leg,
      to which both painters and satirists took care to give prominence, was
      among his chief qualifications for the stage. He devised quaint dresses
      for masquerades. He dabbled in geometry, mechanics, and botany. He paid
      some attention to antiquities and works of art, and was considered in his
      own circle as a judge of painting, architecture, and poetry. It is said
      that his spelling was incorrect. But though, in our time, incorrect
      spelling is justly considered as a proof of sordid ignorance, it would be
      unjust to apply the same rule to people who lived a century ago. The novel
      of Sir Charles Grandison was published about the time at which Lord Bute
      made his appearance at Leicester House. Our readers may perhaps remember
      the account which Charlotte <span class="pagenum">20</span><a name="link20"
       id="link20"></a>Grandison gives of her two lovers. One of them, a
      fashionable baronet who talks French and Italian fluently, cannot write a
      line in his own language without some sin against orthography: the other,
      who is represented as a most respectable specimen of the young
      aristocracy, and something of a virtuoso, is described as spelling pretty
      well for a lord. On the whole, the Earl of Bute might fairly be called a
      man of cultivated mind. He was also a man of undoubted honour. But his
      understanding was narrow, and his manners cold and haughty. His
      qualifications for the part of a statesman were best described by
      Frederic, who often indulged in the unprincely luxury of sneering at his
      dependents. &ldquo;Bute,&rdquo; said his Royal Highness, &ldquo;you are the very man to be
      envoy at some small proud German court where there is nothing to do.&rdquo;
       Scandal represented the Groom of the Stole as the favoured lover of the
      Princess Dowager. He was undoubtedly her confidential friend. The
      influence which the two united exercised over the mind of the King was for
      a time unbounded. The Princess, a woman and a foreigner, was not likely to
      be a judicious adviser about affairs of state. The Earl could scarcely be
      said to have served even a noviciate in politics. His notions of
      government had been acquired in the society which had been in the habit of
      assembling round Frederic at Kew and Leicester House, That society
      consisted principally of Tories, who had been reconciled to the House of
      Hanover by the civility with which the Prince had treated them, and by the
      hope of obtaining high preferment when he should come to the throne. Their
      political creed was a peculiar modification of Toryism. It was the creed
      neither of the Tories of the seventeenth nor of the Tories of <span
      class="pagenum">21</span><a name="link21" id="link21"></a>the nineteenth
      century. It was the creed, not of Filmer and Sacheverell, not of Perceval
      and Eldon, but of the sect of which Bolingbroke may be considered as the
      chief doctor. This sect deserves commendation for having pointed out and
      justly reprobated some great abuses which sprang up during the long
      domination of the Whigs. But it is far easier to point out and reprobate
      abuses than to propose beneficial reforms: and the reforms which
      Bolingbroke proposed would either have been utterly inefficient, or would
      have produced much more mischief than they would have removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Revolution had saved the nation from one class of evils, but had at
      the same time&mdash;such is the imperfection of all things human&mdash;engendered
      or aggravated another class of evils which required new remedies. Liberty
      and property were secure from the attacks of prerogative. Conscience was
      respected. No government ventured to infringe any of the-rights solemnly
      recognised by the instrument which had called William and Mary to the
      throne. But it cannot be denied that, under the new system, the public
      interests and the public morals were seriously endangered by corruption
      and faction. During the long struggle against the Stuarts, the chief
      object of the most enlightened statesmen had been to strengthen the House
      of Commons. The struggle was over; the victory was won; the House of
      Commons was supreme in the state: and all the vices which had till then
      been latent in the representative system were rapidly developed by
      prosperity and power. Scarcely had the executive government become really
      responsible to the House of Commons, when it began to appear that the
      House of Commons was not really responsible to the nation. Many of the
      constituent bodies were under the absolute control <span class="pagenum">22</span><a
      name="link22" id="link22"></a>of individuals; many were notoriously at the
      command of the highest bidder. The debates were not published. It was very
      seldom known out of doors how a gentleman had voted. Thus, while the
      ministry was accountable to the Parliament, the majority of the Parliament
      was accountable to nobody. In such circumstances, nothing could be more
      natural than that the members should insist on being paid for their votes,
      should form themselves into combinations for the purpose of raising the
      price of their votes, and should at critical conjunctures extort large
      wages by threatening a strike. Thus the Whig ministers of George the First
      and George the Second were com-pelled to reduce corruption to a system,
      and to practise it on a gigantic scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are right as to the cause of these abuses, we can scarcely be wrong
      as to the remedy. The remedy was surely not to deprive the House of
      Commons of its weight in the state. Such a course would undoubtedly have
      put an end to parliamentary corruption and to parliamentary factions: for,
      when votes cease to be of importance, they will cease to be bought; and,
      when knaves can get nothing by combining, they will cease to combine. But
      to destroy corruption and faction by introducing despotism would have been
      to cure bad by worse. The proper remedy evidently was, to make the House
      of Commons responsible to the nation; and this was to be effected in two
      ways; first, by giving-publicity to parliamentary proceedings, and thus
      placing every member on his trial before the tribunal of public opinion;
      and secondly, by so reforming the constitution of the House that no man
      should be able to sit in it who had not been returned by a respectable and
      independent body of constituents. <span class="pagenum">23</span><a
      name="link23" id="link23"></a>Bolingbroke and Bolingbroke&rsquo;s disciples
      recommended a very different mode of treating the diseases of the state.
      Their doctrine was that a vigorous use of the prerogative by a patriot
      King would at once break all factious combinations, and supersede the
      pretended necessity of bribing members of Parliament. The King had only to
      resolve that he would be master, that he would not be held in thraldom by
      any set of men, that he would take for ministers any persons in whom he
      had confidence, without distinction of party, and that he would restrain
      his servants from influencing by immoral means either the constituent
      bodies or the representative body. This childish scheme proved that those
      who proposed it knew nothing of the nature of the evil with which they
      pretended to deal. The real cause of the prevalence of corruption and
      fiction was that a House of Commons, not accountable to the people, was
      more powerful than the King. Bolingbroke&rsquo;s remedy could be applied only by
      a King more powerful than the House of Commons. How was the patriot Prince
      to govern in defiance of the body without whose consent he could not equip
      a sloop, keep a battalion under arms, send an embassy, or defray even the
      charges of his own household? Was he to dissolve the Parliament? And what
      was he likely to gain by appealing to Sudbury and Old Sarum against the
      venality of their representatives? Was he to send out privy seals? Was he
      to levy ship-money? If so, this boasted reform must commence in all
      probability by civil war, and, if consummated, must be consummated by the
      establishment of absolute monarchy. Or was the patriot King to carry the
      House of Commons with him in his upright designs? By what means?
      Interdicting himself from the use of corrupt influence, what motive <span
      class="pagenum">24</span><a name="link24" id="link24"></a>was he to
      address to the Dodingtons and Winningtons? Was cupidity, strengthened by
      habit, to be laid asleep by a few fine sentences about virtue and union?
    </p>
    <p>
      Absurd as this theory was, it had many admirers, particularly among men of
      letters. It was now to be reduced to practice; and the result was, as any
      man of sagacity must have foreseen, the most piteous and ridiculous of
      failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very day of the young King&rsquo;s accession, appeared some signs which
      indicated the approach of a great change. The speech which he made to his
      council was not submitted to the cabinet. It was drawn up by Bute, and
      contained some expressions which might be construed into reflections on
      the conduct of affairs during the late reign. Pitt remonstrated, and
      begged that these expressions might be softened down in the printed copy;
      but it was not till after some hours of altercation that Bute yielded;
      and, even after Bute had yielded, the King affected to hold out till the
      following afternoon. On the same day on which this singular contest took
      place, Bute was not only sworn of the privy council, but introduced into
      the cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this, Lord Holdernesse, one of the Secretaries of State, in
      pursuance of a plan concerted with the court, resigned the seals. Bute was
      instantly appointed to the vacant place. A general election speedily
      followed, and the new Secretary entered parliament in the only way in
      which he then could enter it, as one of the sixteen representative peers
      of Scotland. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) In the reign of Anne, the House of Lords had resolved
     that, under the 23d article of Union, no Scotch peer could
     be created a peer of Great Britain. This resolution was not
     annulled till the year 1782.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">25</span><a name="link25" id="link25"></a>Had the
      ministers been firmly united it can scarcely be doubted that they would
      have been able to withstand the court. The parliamentary influence of the
      Whig aristocracy, combined with the genius, the virtue, and the firmness
      of Pitt, would have been irresistible. But there had been in the cabinet
      of George the Second latent jealousies and enmities, which now began to
      show themselves. Pitt had been estranged from his old ally Legge, the
      Chancellor of the Exchequer. Some of the ministers were envious of Pitt&rsquo;s
      popularity. Others were, not altogether without cause, disgusted by his
      imperious and haughty demeanour. Others, again, were honestly opposed to
      some parts of his policy. They admitted that he had found the country in
      the depths of humiliation, and had raised it to the height of glory: they
      admitted that he had conducted the war with energy, ability, and splendid
      success; but they began to hint that the drain on the resources of the
      state was unexampled, and that the public debt was increasing with a speed
      at which Montague or Godolphin would have stood aghast. Some of the
      acquisitions made by our fleets and armies were, it was acknowledged,
      profitable as well as honourable; but, now that George the Second was
      dead, a courtier might venture to ask why England was to become a party in
      a dispute between two German powers. What was it to her whether the House
      of Hapsburg or the House of Brandenburg ruled in Silesia? Why were the
      best English regiments fighting on the Main? Why were the Prussian
      battalions paid with English gold? The great minister seemed to think it
      beneath him to calculate the price of victory. As long as the Tower guns
      were fired, as the streets were illuminated, as French banners were
      carried in triumph through London, it was to him matter of indifference to
      what extent <span class="pagenum">26</span><a name="link26" id="link26"></a>the
      public burdens were augmented. Nay, he seemed to glory in the magnitude of
      those sacrifices which the people, fascinated by his eloquence and
      success, had too readily made, and would long and bitterly regret. There
      was no check on waste or embezzlement. Our commissaries returned from the
      camp of Prince Ferdinand to buy boroughs, to rear palaces, to rival the
      magnificence of the old aristocracy of the realm. Already had we borrowed,
      in four years of war, more than the most skilful and economical government
      would pay in forty years of peace. But the prospect of peace was as remote
      as ever. It could not be doubted that France, smarting and prostrate,
      would consent to fair terms of accommodation; but this was not what Pitt
      wanted. War had made him powerful and popular; with war, all that was
      brightest in his life was associated: for war his talents were peculiarly
      fitted. He had at length begun to love war for its own sake, and was more
      disposed to quarrel with neutrals than to make peace with enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the views of the Duke of Bedford and of the Earl of Hardwicke;
      but no member of the government held these opinions so strongly as George
      Grenville, the treasurer of the navy. George Grenville was brother-in-law
      of Pitt, and had always been reckoned one of Pitt&rsquo;s personal and political
      friends. But it is difficult to conceive two men of talents and integrity
      more utterly unlike each other. Pitt, as his sister often said, knew
      nothing accurately except Spenser&rsquo;s Fairy Queen. He had never applied
      himself steadily to any branch of knowledge. He was a wretched financier.
      He never became familiar even with the rules of that House of which he was
      the brightest ornament. He had never studied public law <span
      class="pagenum">27</span><a name="link27" id="link27"></a>as a system; and
      was, indeed, so ignorant of the whole subject, that George the Second, on
      one occasion, complained bitterly that a man who had never read Vattel
      should presume to undertake the direction of foreign affairs. But these
      defects were more than redeemed by high and rare gifts, by a strange power
      of inspiring great masses of men with confidence and affection, by an
      eloquence which not only delighted the ear, but stirred the blood, and
      brought tears into the eyes, by originality in devising plans, by vigour
      in executing them. Grenville, on the other hand, was by nature and habit a
      man of details. He had been bred a lawyer; and he had brought the industry
      and acuteness of the Temple into official and parliamentary life. He was
      supposed to be intimately acquainted with the whole fiscal system of the
      country. He had paid especial attention to the law of Parliament, and was
      so learned in all things relating to the privileges and orders of the
      House of Commons that those who loved him least pronounced him the only
      person competent to succeed Onslow in the Chair. His speeches were
      generally instructive, and sometimes, from the gravity and earnestness
      with which he spoke, even impressive, but never brilliant, and generally
      tedious. Indeed, even when he was at the head of affairs, he sometimes
      found it difficult to obtain the ear of the House. In disposition as well
      as in intellect, he differed widely from his brother-in-law. Pitt was
      utterly regardless of money. He would scarcely stretch out his hand to
      take it; and, when it came, he threw it away with childish profusion.
      Grenville, though strictly upright, was grasping and parsimonious. Pitt
      was a man of excitable nerves, sanguine in hope, easily elated by success
      and popularity, keenly sensible of injury, but prompt to forgive; <span
      class="pagenum">28</span><a name="link28" id="link28"></a>Grenville&rsquo;s
      character was stern, melancholy, and pertinacious. Nothing was more
      remarkable in him than his inclination always to look on the dark side of
      things. He was the raven of the House of Commons, always croaking defeat
      in the midst of triumphs, and bankruptcy with an overflowing exchequer.
      Burke, with general applause, compared him, in a time of quiet and plenty,
      to the evil spirit whom Ovid described looking down on the stately temples
      and wealthy haven of Athens, and scarce able to refrain from weeping
      because she could find nothing at which to weep. Such a man was not likely
      to be popular. But to unpopularity Grenville opposed a dogged
      determination, which sometimes forced even those who hated him to respect
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural that Pitt and Grenville, being such as they were, should
      take very different views of the situation of affairs. Pitt could see
      nothing but the trophies; Grenville could see nothing but the bill. Pitt
      boasted that England was victorious at once in America, in India, and in
      Germany, the umpire of the Continent, the mistress of the sea. Grenville
      cast up the subsidies, sighed over the army extraordinaries, and groaned
      in spirit to think that the nation had borrowed eight millions in one
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a ministry thus divided it was not difficult for Bute to deal. Legge
      was the first who fell. He had given offence to the young King in the late
      reign, by refusing to support a creature of Bute at a Hampshire election.
      He was now not only turned out, but in the closet, when he delivered up
      his seal of office, was treated with gross incivility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt, who did not love Legge, saw this event with indifference. But the
      danger was now fast approaching <span class="pagenum">29</span><a
      name="link29" id="link29"></a>himself. Charles the Third of Spain had
      early conceived a deadly hatred of England. Twenty years before, when he
      was King of the Two Sicilies, he had been eager to join the coalition
      against Maria Theresa, But an English fleet had suddenly appeared in the
      Bay of Naples. An English captain had landed, had proceeded to the palace,
      had laid a watch on the table, and had told his majesty that, within an
      hour, a treaty of neutrality must be signed, or a bombardment would
      commence. The treaty was signed; the squadron sailed out of the bay
      twenty-four hours after it had sailed in; and from that day the ruling
      passion of the humbled Prince was aversion to the English name. He was at
      length in a situation in which he might hope to gratify that passion. He
      had recently become King of Spain and the Indies. He saw, with envy and
      apprehension, the triumphs of our navy, and the rapid extension of our
      colonial Empire. He was a Bourbon, and sympathized with the distress of
      the house from which he sprang. He was a Spaniard; and no Spaniard could
      bear to see Gibraltar and Minorca in the possession of a foreign power.
      Impelled by such feelings, Charles concluded a secret treaty with France.
      By this treaty, known as the Family Compact, the two powers bound
      themselves not in express words, but by the clearest implication, to make
      war on England in common. Spain postponed the declaration of hostilities
      only till her fleet, laden with the treasures of America, should have
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of the treaty could not be kept a secret from Pitt. He acted
      as a man of his capacity and energy might be expected to act. He at once
      proposed to declare war against Spain, and to intercept <span
      class="pagenum">30</span><a name="link30" id="link30"></a>the American
      fleet. He had determined, it is said, to attack without delay both Havanna
      and the Philippines.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wise and resolute counsel was rejected. Bute was foremost in opposing
      it, and was supported by almost the whole cabinet. Some of the ministers
      doubted, or affected to doubt, the correctness of Pitt&rsquo;s intelligence;
      some shrank from the responsibility of advising a course so bold and
      decided as that which he proposed; some were weary of his ascendency, and
      were glad to be rid of him on any pretext. One only of his colleagues
      agreed with him, his brother-in-law, Earl Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt and Temple resigned their offices. To Pitt the young King behaved at
      parting in the most gracious manner. Pitt, who, proud and fiery every
      where else, was always meek and humble in the closet, was moved even to
      tears. The King and the favourite urged him to accept some substantial
      mark of royal gratitude. Would he like to be appointed governor of Canada?
      A salary of five thousand pounds a year should be annexed to the office.
      Residence would not be required. It was true that the governor of Canada,
      as the law then stood, could not be a member of the House of Commons. But
      a bill should be brought in, authorising Pitt to hold his government
      together with a seat in Parliament, and in the preamble should be set
      forth his claims to the gratitude of his country. Pitt answered, with all
      delicacy, that his anxieties were rather for his wife and family than for
      himself, and that nothing would be so acceptable to him as a mark of royal
      goodness which might be beneficial to those who were dearest to him. The
      hint was taken. The same Gazette which announced the retirement of the
      Secretary of <span class="pagenum">31</span><a name="link31" id="link31"></a>State
      announced also that, in consideration of his great public services, his
      wife had been created a peeress in her own right, and that a pension of
      three thousand pounds a year, for three lives, had been bestowed on
      himself. It was doubtless thought that the rewards and honours conferred
      on the great minister would have a conciliatory effect on the public mind.
      Perhaps, too, it was thought that his popularity, which had partly arisen
      from the contempt which he had always shown for money, would be damaged by
      a pension; and, indeed, a crowd of libels instantly appeared, in which he
      was accused of having sold his country. Many of his true friends thought
      that he would have best consulted the dignity of his character by refusing
      to accept any pecuniary reward from the court. Nevertheless, the general
      opinion of his talents, virtues, and services, remained unaltered.
      Addresses were presented to him from several large towns. London showed
      its admiration and affection in a still more marked manner. Soon after his
      resignation came the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s day. The King and the royal family dined
      at Guildhall. Pitt was one of the guests. The young Sovereign, seated by
      his bride in his state coach, received a remarkable lesson. He was
      scarcely noticed. All eyes were fixed on the fallen minister; all
      acclamations directed to him. The streets, the balconies, the chimney
      tops, burst into a roar of delight as his chariot passed by. The ladies
      waved their handkerchiefs from the windows. The common people clung to the
      wheels, shook hands with the footmen, and even kissed the horses. Cries of
      &ldquo;No Bute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Newcastle salmon!&rdquo; were mingled with the shouts of &ldquo;Pitt for ever!&rdquo;
       When Pitt entered Guildhall, he was welcomed by loud huzzas and clapping
      of hands, <span class="pagenum">32</span><a name="link32" id="link32"></a>in
      which the very magistrates of the city joined. Lord Bute, in the mean
      time, was hooted and pelted through Cheapside, and would, it was thought,
      have been in some danger, if he had not taken the precaution of
      surrounding his carriage with a strong body guard of boxers. Many persons
      blamed the conduct of Pitt on this occasion as disrespectful to the King.
      Indeed, Pitt himself afterwards owned that he had done wrong. He was led
      into this error, as he was afterwards led into more serious errors, by the
      influence of his turbulent and mischievous brother-in-law, Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The events which immediately followed Pitt&rsquo;s retirement raised his fame
      higher than ever. War with Spain proved to be, as he had predicted,
      inevitable. News came from the West Indies that Martinique had been taken
      by an expedition which he had sent forth. Havanna fell; and it was known
      that he had planned an attack on Favanna. Manilla capitulated; and it was
      believed that he had meditated a blow against Manilla. The American fleet,
      which he had proposed to intercept, had unloaded an immense cargo of
      bullion in the haven of Cadiz, before Bute could be convinced that the
      Court of Madrid really entertained hostile intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The session of Parliament which followed Pitt&rsquo;s retirement passed over
      without any violent storm. Lord Bute took on himself the most prominent
      part in the House of Lords. He had become Secretary of State, and indeed
      prime minister, without having once opened his lips in public except as an
      actor. There was, therefore, no small curiosity to know how he would
      acquit himself. Members of the House of Commons crowded the bar of the
      Lords, and covered the steps of the throne. It was generally expected
      <span class="pagenum">33</span><a name="link33" id="link33"></a>that the
      orator would break down; but his most malicious hearers were forced to own
      that he had made a better figure than they expected. They, indeed,
      ridiculed his action as theatrical, and his style as tumid. They were
      especially amused by the long pauses which, not from hesitation, but from
      affectation, he made at all the emphatic words, and Charles Townshend
      cried out, &ldquo;Minute guns!&rdquo; The general opinion however was, that, if Bute
      had been early practised in debate, he might have become an impressive
      speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Commons, George Grenville had been intrusted with the lead. The
      task was not, as yet, a very difficult one: for Pitt did not think fit to
      raise the standard of opposition. His speeches at this time were
      distinguished, not only by that eloquence in which he excelled all his
      rivals, but also by a temperance and a modesty which had too often been
      wanting to his character. When war was declared against Spain, he justly
      laid claim to the merit of having foreseen what had at length become
      manifest to all, but he carefully abstained from arrogant and acrimonious
      expressions; and this abstinence was the more honourable to him, because
      his temper, never very placid, was now severely tried, both by gout and by
      calumny. The courtiers had adopted a mode of warfare, which was soon
      turned with far more formidable effect against themselves. Half the
      inhabitants of the Grub Street garrets paid their milk scores, and got
      their shirts out of pawn, by abusing Pitt. His German war, his subsidies,
      his pension, his wife&rsquo;s peerage, were shin of beef and gin, blankets and
      baskets of small coal, to the starving poetasters of the Fleet. Even in
      the House of Commons, he was, on one occasion during <span class="pagenum">34</span><a
      name="link34" id="link34"></a>this session, assailed with an insolence and
      malice which called forth the indignation of men of all parties; but he
      endured the outrage with majestic patience. In his younger days he had
      been but too prompt to retaliate on those who attacked him; but now,
      conscious of his great services, and of the space which he filled in the
      eyes of all mankind, he would not stoop to personal squabbles. &ldquo;This is no
      season,&rdquo; he said, in the debate on the Spanish war, &ldquo;for altercation and
      recrimination. A day has arrived when every Englishman should stand forth
      for his country. Arm the whole; be one people; forget every thing but the
      public. I set you the example. Harassed by slanderers, sinking under pain
      and disease, for the publie I forget both my wrongs and my infirmities!&rdquo;
       On a general review of his life, we are inclined to think that his genius
      and virtue never shone with so pure an effulgence as during the session of
      1762.
    </p>
    <p>
      The session drew towards the close; and Bute, emboldened by the
      acquiescence of the Houses, resolved to strike another great blow, and to
      become first minister in name as well as in reality. That coalition, which
      a few months before had seemed all powerful, had been dissolved. The
      retreat of Pitt had deprived the government of popularity. Newcastle had
      exulted in the fall of the illustrious colleague whom he envied and
      dreaded, and had not foreseen that his own doom was at hand; he still
      tried to flatter himself that he was at the head of the government; but
      insults heaped on insults at length undeceived him. Places which had
      always been considered as in his gift, were bestowed without any reference
      to him. His expostulations only called forth significant hints that it was
      time for him to retire. <span class="pagenum">35</span><a name="link35"
       id="link35"></a>One day he pressed on Bute the claims of a Whig Prelate to
      the archbishopric of York. &ldquo;If your grace thinks so highly of him,&rdquo;
       answered Bute, &ldquo;I wonder that you did not promote him when you had the
      power.&rdquo; Still the old man clung with a desperate grasp to the wreck.
      Seldom, indeed, have Christian meekness and Christian humility equalled
      the meekness and humility of his patient and abject ambition. At length he
      was forced to understand that all was over. He quitted that Court where he
      had held high office during forty-five years, and hid his shame and regret
      among the cedars of Claremont. Bute became first lord of the treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The favourite had undoubtedly committed a great error. It is impossible to
      imagine a tool better suited to his purposes than that which he thus threw
      away, or rather put into the hands of his enemies. If Newcastle had been
      suffered to play at being first minister, Bute might securely and quietly
      have enjoyed the substance of power. The gradual introduction of Tories
      into all the departments of the government might have been effected
      without any violent clamour, if the chief of the great Whig connection had
      been ostensibly at the head of affairs. This was strongly represented to
      Bute by Lord Mansfield, a man who may justly be called the father of
      modern Toryism, of Toryism modified to suit an order of things under which
      the House of Commons is the most powerful body in the state. The theories
      which had dazzled Bute could not impose on the fine intellect of
      Mansfield. The temerity with which Bute provoked the hostility of powerful
      and deeply rooted interests, was displeasing to Mansfield&rsquo;s cold and timid
      nature. Expostulation, however, was vain. Bute was impatient of advice,
      <span class="pagenum">36</span><a name="link36" id="link36"></a>drunk with
      success, eager to he, in show as well as in reality, the head of the
      government. He had engaged in an undertaking in which a screen was
      absolutely necessary to his success, and even to his safety. He found an
      excellent screen ready in the very place where it was most needed; and he
      rudely pushed it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the new system of government came into full operation. For the
      first time since the accession of the House of Hanover, the Tory party was
      in the ascendant. The prime minister himself was a Tory. Lord Egremont,
      who had succeeded Pitt as Secretary of State, was a Tory, and the son of a
      Tory. Sir Francis Dash wood, a man of slender parts, of small experience,
      and of notoriously immoral character, was made Chancellor of the
      Exchequer, for no reason that could be imagined, except that he was a
      Tory, and had been a Jacobite. The royal household was filled with men
      whose favourite toast, a few years before, had been the King over the
      water. The relative position of the two great national seats of learning
      was suddenly changed. The University of Oxford had long been the chief
      seat of disaffection. In troubled times, the High Street had been lined
      with bayonets; the colleges had been searched by the King&rsquo;s messengers.
      Grave doctors were in the habit of talking very Ciceronian treason in the
      theatre; and the undergraduates drank bumpers to Jacobite toasts, and
      chanted Jacobite airs. Of four successive Chancellors of the University,
      one had notoriously been in the Pretender&rsquo;s service; the other three were
      fully believed to be in secret correspondence with the exiled family.
      Cambridge had therefore been especially favoured by the Hanoverian
      Princes, and had shown herself grateful <span class="pagenum">37</span><a
      name="link37" id="link37"></a>for their patronage. George the First had
      enriched her library; George the Second had contributed munificently to
      her Senate House. Bishoprics and deaneries were showered on her children.
      Her Chancellor was Newcastle, the chief of the Whig aristocracy; her High
      Steward was Hardwicke, the Whig head of the law. Both her burgesses had
      held office under the Whig ministry. Times had now changed. The University
      of Cambridge was received at St. James&rsquo;s with comparative coldness. The
      answers to the addresses of Oxford were all graciousness and warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchwords of the new government were prerogative and purity. The
      sovereign was no longer to be a puppet in the hands of any subject, or of
      any combination of subjects. George the Third would not be forced to take
      ministers whom he disliked, as his grandfather had been forced to take
      Pitt. George the Third would not be forced to part with any whom he
      delighted to honour, as his grandfather had been forced to part with
      Carteret. At the same time, the system of bribery which had grown up
      during the late reigns was to cease. It was ostentatiously proclaimed
      that, since the accession of the young King, neither constituents nor
      representatives had been bought with the secret service money. To free
      Britain from corruption and oligarchical cabals, to detach her from
      continental connections, to bring the bloody and expensive war with France
      and Spain to a close, such were the specious objects which Bute professed
      to procure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these objects he attained. England withdrew, at the cost of a deep
      stain on her faith, from her German connections. The war with France and
      Spain was terminated by a peace, honourable indeed and advantageous <span
      class="pagenum">38</span><a name="link38" id="link38"></a>to our country,
      yet less honourable and less advantageous than might have been expected
      from a long and almost unbroken series of victories, by land and sea, in
      every part of the world. But the only effect of Bute&rsquo;s domestic
      administration was to make faction wilder, and corruption fouler than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mutual animosity of the Whig and Tory parties had begun to languish
      after the fall of Walpole, and had seemed to be almost extinct at the
      close of the reign of George the Second. It now revived in all its force.
      Many Whigs, it is true, were still in office. The Duke of Bedford had
      signed the treaty with France. The Duke of Devonshire, though much out of
      humour, still continued to be Lord Chamberlain. Grenville, who led the
      House of Commons, and Fox, who still enjoyed in silence the immense gains
      of the Pay Office, had always been regarded as strong Whigs. But the bulk
      of the party throughout the country regarded the new minister with
      abhorrence. There was, indeed, no want of popular themes for invective
      against his character. He was a favourite; and favourites have always been
      odious in this country. No mere favourite had been at the head of the
      government since the dagger of Felton had reached the heart of the Duke of
      Buckingham. After that event the most arbitrary and the most frivolous of
      the Stuarts had felt the necessity of confiding the chief direction of
      affairs to men who had given some proof of parliamentary or official
      talent. Strafford, Falkland, Clarendon, Clifford, Shaftesbury, Lauderdale,
      Dauby, Temple, Halifax, Rochester, Sunderland, whatever their faults might
      be, were all men of acknowledged ability. They did not owe their eminence
      merely to the favour of the sovereign. On the contrary, they owed the
      favour of the <span class="pagenum">39</span><a name="link39" id="link39"></a>sovereign
      to their eminence. Most of them, indeed, had first attracted the notice of
      the court by the capacity and vigour which they had shown in opposition.
      The Revolution seemed to have for ever secured the state against the
      domination of a Carr or a Villiers. Now, however, the personal regard of
      the King had at once raised a man who had seen nothing of public business,
      who had never opened his lips in parliament, over the heads of a crowd of
      eminent orators, financiers, diplomatists. From a private gentleman, this
      fortunate minion had at once been turned into a Secretary of State. He had
      made his maiden speech when at the head of the administration. The vulgar
      resorted to a simple explanation of the phenomenon, and the coarsest
      ribaldry against the Princess Mother was scrawled on every wall and sung
      in every alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not all. The spirit of party, roused by impolitic provocation
      from its long sleep, roused in turn a still fiercer and more malignant
      Fury, the spirit of national animosity. The grudge of Whig against Tory
      was mingled with the grudge of Englishman against Scot. The two sections
      of the great British people had not yet been indissolubly blended
      together. The events of 1715 and of 1745 had left painful and enduring
      traces. The tradesmen of Cornhill had been in dread of seeing their tills
      and warehouses plundered by barelegged mountaineers from the Grampians.
      They still recollected that Black Friday, when the news came that the
      rebels were at Derby, when all the shops in the city were closed, and when
      the Bank of England began to pay in sixpences. The Scots, on the other
      hand, remembered, with natural resentment, the severity with which the
      insurgents had been chastised, the military outrages, the humiliating
      laws, the heads <span class="pagenum">40</span><a name="link40" id="link40"></a>fixed
      on Temple Bar, the fires and quartering blocks on Kennington Common. The
      favourite did not suffer the English to forget from what part of the
      island he came. The cry of all the south was that the public offices, the
      army, the navy, were filled with highcheeked Drummonds and Erskines,
      Macdonalds and Macgillivrays, who could not talk a Christian tongue, and
      some of whom had but lately begun to wear Christian breeches. All the old
      jokes on hills without trees, girls without stockings, men eating the food
      of horses, pails emptied from the fourteenth story, were pointed against
      these lucky adventurers. To the honour of the Scots it must be said, that
      their prudence and their pride restrained them from retaliation. Like the
      princess in the Arabian tale, they stopped their ears tight, and, unmoved
      by the shrillest notes of abuse, walked on, without once looking round,
      straight towards the Golden Fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bute, who had always been considered as a man of taste and reading,
      affected, from the moment of his elevation, the character of a Mæcenas. If
      he expected to conciliate the public by encouraging literature and art, he
      was grievously mistaken. Indeed, none of the objects of his munificence,
      with the single exception of Johnson, can be said to have been well
      selected; and the public, not unnaturally, ascribed the selection of
      Johnson rather to the Doctor&rsquo;s political prejudices than to his literary
      merits: for a wretched scribbler named Shebbeare, who had nothing in
      common with Johnson except violent Jacobitism, and who had stood in the
      pillory for a libel on the Revolution, was honoured with a mark of royal
      approbation, similar to that which was bestowed on the author of the
      English Dictionary, and of the Vanity of Human Wishes. It <span
      class="pagenum">41</span><a name="link41" id="link41"></a>was remarked
      that Adam, a Scotchman, was the court architect, and that Ramsay, a
      Scotchman, was the court painter, and was preferred to Reynolds. Mallet, a
      Scotchman, of no high literary fame, and of infamous character, partook
      largely of the liberality of the government. John Home, a Scotchman, was
      rewarded for the tragedy of Douglas, both with a pension and with a
      sinecure place. But, when the author of the Bard, and of the Elegy in a
      Country Churchyard, ventured to ask for a Professorship, the emoluments of
      which he much needed, and for the duties of which he was, in many
      respects, better qualified than any man living, he was refused; and the
      post was bestowed on the pedagogue under whose care the favourite&rsquo;s
      son-in-law, Sir James Lowther, had made such signal proficiency in the
      graces and in the humane virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the first lord of the treasury was detested by many as a Tory, by
      many as a favourite, and by many as a Scot. All the hatred which flowed
      from these various sources soon mingled, and was directed in one torrent
      of obloquy against the treaty of peace. The Duke of Bedford, who had
      negotiated that treaty, was hooted through the streets. Bute was attacked
      in his chair, and was with difficulty rescued by a troop of the guards. He
      could hardly walk the streets in safety without disguising himself. A
      gentleman who died not many years ago used to say that he once recognised
      the favourite Earl in the piazza of Covent Garden, muffled in a large
      coat, and with a hat and wig drawn down over his brows. His lordship&rsquo;s
      established type with the mob was a jack boot, a wretched pun on his
      Christian name and title. A jack boot, generally accompanied by a
      petticoat, was sometimes fastened on a <span class="pagenum">42</span><a
      name="link42" id="link42"></a>gallows, and sometimes committed to the
      flames. Libels on the court, exceeding in audacity and rancour any that
      had been published for many years, now appeared daily, both in prose and
      verse. Wilkes, with lively insolence, compared the mother of George the
      Third to the mother of Edward the Third, and the Scotch minister to the
      gentle Mortimer. Churchill, with all the energy of hatred, deplored the
      fate of his country, invaded by a new race of savages, more cruel and
      ravenous than the Picts or the Danes, the poor, proud children of Leprosy
      and Hunger. It is a slight circumstance, but deserves to be recorded, that
      in this year pamphleteers first ventured to print at length the names of
      the great men whom they lampooned. George the Second had always been the K&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      His ministers had been Sir R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and the Duke of N&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. But
      the libellers of George the Third, of the Princess Mother, and of Lord
      Bute did not give quarter to a single vowel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was supposed that Lord Temple secretly encouraged the most scurrilous
      assailants of the government. In truth, those who knew his habits tracked
      him as men track a mole. It was his nature to grub underground. Whenever a
      heap of dirt was flung up it might well be suspected that he was at work
      in some foul crooked labyrinth below. Pitt turned away from the filthy
      work of opposition, with the same scorn with which he had turned away from
      the filthy work of government. He had the magnanimity to proclaim every
      where the disgust which he felt at the insults offered by his own
      adherents to the Scottish nation, and missed no opportunity of extolling
      the courage and fidelity which the Highland regiments had displayed
      through the whole war. But, though he disdained to <span class="pagenum">43</span><a
      name="link43" id="link43"></a>use any but lawful and honourable weapons,
      it was well known that his fair blows were likely to be far more
      formidable than the privy thrusts of his brother-in-law&rsquo;s stiletto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bute&rsquo;s heart began to fail him. The Houses were about to meet. The treaty
      would instantly be the subject of discussion. It was probable that Pitt,
      the great Whig connection, and the multitude, would all be on the same
      side. The favourite had professed to hold in abhorrence those means by
      which preceding ministers had kept the House of Commons in good humour. He
      now began to think that he had been too scrupulous. His Utopian visions
      were at an end. It was necessary, not only to bribe, but to bribe more
      shamelessly and flagitiously than his predecessors, in order to make up
      for lost time. A majority must be secured, no matter by what means. Could
      Grenville do this? Would he do it? His firmness and ability had not yet
      been tried in any perilous crisis. He had been generally regarded as a
      humble follower of his brother Temple, and of his brother-in-law Pitt, and
      was supposed, though with little reason, to be still favourably inclined
      towards them. Other aid must be called in. And where was other aid to be
      found?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one man, whose sharp and manly logic had often in debate been
      found a match for the lofty and impassioned rhetoric of Pitt, whose
      talents for jobbing were not inferior to his talents for debate, whose
      dauntless spirit shrank from no difficulty or danger, and who was as
      little troubled with scruples as with fears. Henry Fox, or nobody, could
      weather the storm which was about to burst. Yet was he a person to whom
      the court, even in that extremity, was unwilling to have recourse. He had
      always been regarded <span class="pagenum">44</span><a name="link44"
       id="link44"></a>as a Whig of the Whigs. He had been the friend and
      disciple of Walpole. He had long been connected by close ties with William
      Duke of Cumberland. By the Tories he was more hated than any man living.
      So strong was their aversion to him that when, in the late reign, he had
      attempted to form a party against the Duke of Newcastle, they had thrown
      all their weight into Newcastle&rsquo;s scale. By the Scots, Fox was abhorred as
      the confidential friend of the conqueror of Culloden. He was, on personal
      grounds, most obnoxious to the Princess Mother. For he had, immediately
      after her husband&rsquo;s death, advised the late King to take the education of
      her son, the heir apparent, entirely out of her hands. He had recently
      given, if possible, still deeper offence; for he had indulged, not without
      some ground, the ambitious hope that his beautiful sister-in-law, the Lady
      Sarah Lennox, might be queen of England. It had been observed that the
      King at one time rode every morning by the grounds of Holland House, and
      that, on such occasions, Lady Sarah, dressed like a shepherdess at a
      masquerade, was making hay close to the road, which was then separated by
      no wall from the lawn. On account of the part which Fox had taken in this
      singular love affair, he was the only member of the Privy Council who was
      not summoned to the meeting at which his Majesty announced his intended
      marriage with the Princess of Mecklenburg. Of all the statesmen of the
      age, therefore, it seemed that Fox was the last with whom Bute the Tory,
      the Scot, the favourite of the Princess Mother, could, under any
      circumstances, act. Yet to Fox Bute was now compelled to apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fox had many noble and amiable qualities, which in private life shone
      forth in full lustre, and made him <span class="pagenum">45</span><a
      name="link45" id="link45"></a>dear to his children, to his dependents, and
      to his friends; but as a public man he had no title to esteem. In him the
      vices which were common to the whole school of Walpole appeared, not
      perhaps in then-worst, but certainly in their most prominent form; for his
      parliamentary and official talents made all his faults conspicuous. His
      courage, his vehement temper, his contempt for appearances, led him to
      display much that others, quite as unscrupulous as himself, covered with a
      decent veil. He was the most unpopular of the statesmen of his time, not
      because he sinned more than many of them, but because he canted less.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt his unpopularity; but he felt it after the fashion of strong
      minds. He became, not cautious, but reckless, and faced the rage of the
      whole nation with a scowl of inflexible defiance. He was born with a sweet
      and generous temper; but he had been goaded and baited into a savageness
      which was not natural to him, and which amazed and shocked those who knew
      him best. Such was the man to whom Bute, in extreme need, applied for
      succour.
    </p>
    <p>
      That succour Fox was not unwilling to afford. Though by no means of an
      envious temper, he had undoubtedly contemplated the success and popularity
      of Pitt with bitter mortification. He thought himself Pitt&rsquo;s match as a
      debater, and Pitt&rsquo;s superior as a man of business. They had long been
      regarded as well-paired rivals. They had started fair in the career of
      ambition. They had long run side by side. At length Fox had taken the
      lead, and Pitt had fallen behind. Then had come a sudden turn of fortune,
      like that in Virgil&rsquo;s foot-race. Fox had stumbled in the mire, and had not
      only been defeated, but befouled. Pitt had reached the goal, and received
      the prize. The emoluments <span class="pagenum">46</span><a name="link46"
       id="link46"></a>of the Pay Office might induce the defeated statesman to
      submit in silence to the ascendency of his competitor, but, could not
      satisfy a mind conscious of great powers, and sore from great vexations.
      As soon, therefore, as a party arose adverse to the war and to the
      supremacy of the great war minister, the hopes of Fox began to revive. His
      fends with the Princess Mother, with the Scots, with the Tories, he was
      ready to forget, if, by the help of his old enemies, he could now regain
      the importance which he had lost, and confront Pitt on equal terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alliance was, therefore, soon concluded. Fox was assured that, if he
      would pilot the government out of its embarrassing situation, he should be
      rewarded with a peerage, of which he had long been desirous. He undertook
      on his side to obtain, by fair or foul means, a vote in favour of the
      peace. In consequence of this arrangement he became leader of the House of
      Commons; and Grenville, stifling his vexation as well as he could,
      sullenly acquiesced in the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fox had expected that his influence would secure to the court the cordial
      support of some eminent Whigs who were his personal friends, particularly
      of the Duke of Cumberland and of the Duke of Devonshire. He was
      disappointed, and soon found that, in addition to all his other
      difficulties, he must reckon on the opposition of the ablest prince of the
      blood, and of the great house of Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had pledged himself to win the battle; and he was not a man to go
      back. It was no time for squeamishness. Bute was made to comprehend that
      the ministry could be saved only by practising the tactics of Walpole to
      an extent at which Walpole <span class="pagenum">47</span><a name="link47"
       id="link47"></a>himself would have stared. The Pay Office was turned into
      a mart for votes. Hundreds of members were closeted there with Fox, and,
      as there is too much reason to believe, departed carrying with them the
      wages of infamy. It was affirmed by persons who had the best opportunities
      of obtaining information, that twenty-five thousand pounds were thus paid
      away in a single morning. The lowest bribe given, it was said, was a
      bank-note for two hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intimidation was joined with corruption. All ranks, from the highest to
      the lowest, were to be taught that the King would be obeyed. The Lords
      Lieutenants of several counties were dismissed. The Duke of Devonshire was
      especially singled out as the victim by whose fate the magnates of England
      were to take warning. His wealth, rank, and influence, his stainless
      private character, and the constant attachment of his family to the House
      of Hanover did not secure him from gross personal indignity. It was known
      that he disapproved of the course which the government had taken; and it
      was accordingly determined to humble the Prince of the Whigs, as he had
      been nicknamed by the Princess Mother. He went to the palace to pay his
      duty. &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said the King to a page, &ldquo;that I will not see him.&rdquo; The
      page hesitated. &ldquo;Go to him,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and tell him those very
      words.&rdquo; The message was delivered. The Duke tore off his gold key, and
      went away boiling with anger. His relations who were in office instantly
      resigned. A few days later, the King called for the list of Privy
      Councillors, and with his own hand struck out the Duke&rsquo;s name.

    <p>
      In this step there was at least courage, though little wisdom or good
      nature. But, as nothing was too high <span class="pagenum">48</span><a
      name="link48" id="link48"></a>For the revenge of the court, so also was
      nothing too low. A persecution, such as had never been known before, and
      has never been known since, raged in every public department. Great
      numbers of humble and laborious clerks were deprived of their bread, not
      because they had neglected their duties, not because they had taken an
      active part against the ministry, but merely because they had owed their
      situations to the recommendation of some nobleman or gentleman who was
      against the peace. The proscription extended to tidewaiters, to gaugers,
      to doorkeepers. One poor man to whom a pension had been given for his
      gallantry in a fight with smugglers, was deprived of it because he had
      been befriended by the Duke of Grafton. An aged widow, who, on account of
      her husband&rsquo;s services in the navy, had, many years before, been made
      housekeeper to a public office, was dismissed from her situation, because
      it was imagined that she was distantly connected by marriage with the
      Cavendish family. The public clamour, as may well be supposed, grew daily
      louder and louder. But the louder it grew, the more resolutely did Fox go
      on with the work which he had begun. His old friends could not conceive
      what had possessed him. &ldquo;I could forgive,&rdquo; said the Duke of Cumberland,
      &ldquo;Fox&rsquo;s political vagaries; but I am quite confounded by his inhumanity.
      Surely he used to be the best-natured of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Fox went so far as to take a legal opinion on the question,
      whether the patents granted by George the Second were binding on George
      the Third. It is said, that, if his colleagues had not flinched, he would
      at once have turned out the Tellers of the Exchequer and Justices in Eyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Parliament met. The ministers, more <span class="pagenum">49</span><a
      name="link49" id="link49"></a>hated by the people than ever, were secure
      of a majority, and they had also reason to hope that they would have the
      advantage in the debates as well as in the divisions; for Pitt was
      confined to his chamber by a severe attack of gout. His friends moved to
      defer the consideration of the treaty till he should be able to attend:
      but the motion was rejected. The great day arrived. The discussion had
      lasted some time, when a loud huzza was heard in Palace Yard. The noise
      came nearer and nearer, up the stairs, through the lobby. The door opened,
      and from the midst of a shouting multitude came forth Pitt, borne in the
      arms of his attendants. His face was thin and ghastly, his limbs swathed
      in flannel, his crutch in his hand. The bearers set him down within the
      bar. His friends instantly surrounded him, and with their help he crawled
      to his seat near the table. In this condition he spoke three hours and a
      half against the peace. During that time he was repeatedly forced to sit
      down and to use cordials. It may well be supposed that his voice was
      faint, that his action was languid, and that his speech, though
      occasionally brilliant and impressive, was feeble when compared with his
      best oratorical performances. But those who remembered what he had done,
      and who saw what he suffered, listened to him with emotions stronger than
      any that mere eloquence can produce. He was unable to stay for the
      division, and was carried away from the House amidst shouts as loud as
      those which had announced his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large majority approved the peace. The exultation of the court was
      boundless. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; exclaimed the Princess Mother, &ldquo;my son is really King.&rdquo;
       The young sovereign spoke of himself as freed from the <span
      class="pagenum">50</span><a name="link50" id="link50"></a>bondage in which
      his grandfather had been held. On one point, it was announced, his mind
      was unalterably made up. Under no circumstances whatever should those Whig
      grandees, who had enslaved his predecessors and endeavoured to enslave
      himself, be restored to power.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vaunting was premature. The real strength of the favourite was by no
      means proportioned to the number of votes which he had, on one particular
      division, been able to command. He was soon again in difficulties. The
      most important part of his budget was a tax on cider. This measure was
      opposed, not only by those who were generally hostile to his
      administration, but also by many of his supporters. The name of excise had
      always been hateful to the Tories. One of the chief crimes of Walpole in
      their eyes, had been his partiality for this mode of raising money. The
      Tory Johnson had in his Dictionary given so scurrilous a definition of the
      word Excise, that the Commissioners of Excise had seriously thought of
      prosecuting him. The counties which the new impost particularly affected
      had always been Tory counties. It was the boast of John Philips, the poet
      of the English vintage, that the Cider-land had ever been faithful to the
      throne, and that all the pruning-hooks of her thousand orchards had been
      beaten into swords for the service of the ill fated Stuarts. The effect of
      Bute&rsquo;s fiscal scheme was to produce an union between the gentry and
      yeomanry of the Cider-land and the Whigs of the capital. Herefordshire and
      Worcestershire were in a flame. The city of London, though not so directly
      interested, was, if possible, still more excited. The debates on this
      question irreparably damaged the government. Dashwood&rsquo;s financial
      statement <span class="pagenum">51</span><a name="link51" id="link51"></a>had
      been confused and absurd beyond belief, and had been received by the House
      with roars of laughter. He had sense enough to be conscious of his
      unfitness for the high situation which he held, and exclaimed in a comical
      fit of despair, &ldquo;What shall I do? The boys will point at me in the street,
      and cry, &lsquo;There goes the worst Chancellor of the Exchequer that ever
      was.&rsquo;&rdquo; George Grenville came to the rescue, and spoke strongly on his
      favourite theme, the profusion with which the late war had been carried
      on. That profusion, he said, had made taxes necessary. He called on the
      gentlemen opposite to him to say where they would have a tax laid, and
      dwelt on this topic with his usual prolixity. &ldquo;Let them tell me where,&rdquo; he
      repeated in a monotonous and somewhat fretful tone. &ldquo;I say, sir, let them
      tell me where. I repeat it, sir; I am entitled to say to them, Tell me
      where.&rdquo; Unluckily for him, Pitt had come down to the House that night, and
      had been bitterly provoked by the reflections thrown on the war. He
      revenged himself by murmuring, in a whine resembling Grenville&rsquo;s, a line
      of a well known song, &ldquo;Gentle Shepherd, tell me where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; cried Grenville, &ldquo;gentlemen are to be treated in this way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pitt, as was his fashion, when he meant to mark extreme contempt, rose
      deliberately, made his bow, and walked out of the House, leaving his
      brother-in-law in convulsions of rage, and every body else in convulsions
      of laughter. It was long before Grenville lost the nickname of the Gentle
      Shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ministry had vexations still more serious to endure. The hatred
      which the Tories and Scots bore to Fox was implacable. In a moment of
      extreme peril, they had consented to put themselves under his guidance.
      <span class="pagenum">52</span><a name="link52" id="link52"></a>But the
      aversion with which they regarded him broke forth as soon as the crisis
      seemed to be over. Some of them attacked him about the accounts of the Pay
      Office. Some of them rudely interrupted him when speaking, by laughter and
      ironical cheers, he was naturally desirous to escape from so disagreeable
      a situation, and demanded the peerage which had been promised as the
      reward of his services.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that there must be some change in the composition of the
      ministry. But scarcely any, even of those who, from their situation, might
      be supposed to be in all the secrets of the government, anticipated what
      really took place. To the amazement of the Parliament and the nation, it
      was suddenly announced that Bute had resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty different explanations of this strange step were suggested. Some
      attributed it to profound design, and some to sudden panic. Some said that
      the lampoons of the opposition had driven the Earl from the field; some
      that he had taken office only in order to bring the war to a close, and
      had always meant to retire when that object had been accomplished. He
      publicly assigned ill health as his reason for quitting business, and
      privately complained that he was not cordially seconded by his colleagues,
      and that Lord Mansfield, in particular, whom he had himself brought into
      the cabinet, gave him no support in the House of Peers. Mansfield was,
      indeed, far too sagacious not to perceive that Bute&rsquo;s situation was one of
      great peril, and far too timorous to thrust himself into peril for the
      sake of another. The probability, however, is that Bute&rsquo;s conduct on this
      occasion, like the conduct of most men on most occasions, was determined
      by mixed motives. We suspect that he was sick of office; for <span
      class="pagenum">53</span><a name="link53" id="link53"></a>this is a
      feeling much more common among ministers than persons who see public life
      from a distance are disposed to believe; and nothing could be more natural
      than that this feeling should take possession of the mind of Bute. In
      general, a statesman climbs by slow degrees. Many laborious years elapse
      before he reaches the topmost pinnacle of preferment. In the earlier part
      of his career, therefore, he is constantly lured on by seeing something
      above him. During his ascent he gradually becomes inured to the annoyances
      which belong to a life of ambition. By the time that he has attained the
      highest point, he has become patient of labour and callous to abuse. He is
      kept constant to his vocation, in spite of all its discomforts, at first
      by hope, and at last by habit. It was not so with Bute. His whole public
      life lasted little more than two years. On the day on which he became a
      politician he became a cabinet minister. In a few months he was, both in
      name and in show, chief of the administration. Greater than he had been he
      could not be. If what he already possessed was vanity and vexation of
      spirit, no delusion remained to entice him onward. He had been cloyed with
      the pleasures of ambition before he had been seasoned to its pains. His
      habits had not been such as were likely to fortify his mind against
      obloquy and public hatred. He had reached his forty-eighth year in
      dignified ease, without knowing, by personal experience, what it was to be
      ridiculed and slandered. All at once, without any previous initiation, he
      had found himself exposed to such a storm of invective and satire as had
      never burst on the head of any statesman. The emoluments of office were
      now nothing to him; for he had just succeeded to a princely property by
      the death of his father-in-law. All the honours <span class="pagenum">54</span><a
      name="link54" id="link54"></a>which could be bestowed on him he had
      already secured. He had obtained the Garter for himself, and a British
      peerage for his son. He seems also to have imagined that by quitting the
      treasury he should escape from danger and abuse without really resigning
      power, and should still be able to exercise in private supreme influence
      over the royal mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever may have been his motives, he retired. Fox at the same time took
      refuse in the House of Lords; and George Grenville became First Lord of
      the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that those who made this arrangement fully intended that
      Grenville should be a mere puppet in the hands of Bute; for Grenville was
      as yet very imperfectly known even to those who had observed him long. He
      passed for a mere official drudge; and he had all the industry, the minute
      accuracy, the formality, the tediousness, which belong to the character.
      But he had other qualities which had not yet shown themselves, devouring
      ambition, dauntless courage, selfconfidence amounting to presumption, and
      a temper which could not endure opposition. He was not disposed to be any
      body&rsquo;s tool; and he had no attachment, political or personal, to Bute. The
      two men had, indeed, nothing in common, except a strong propensity towards
      harsh and unpopular courses. Their principles were fundamentally
      different. Bute was a Tory. Grenville would have been very angry with any
      person who should have denied his claim to be a Whig. He was more prone to
      tyrannical measures than Bute; but he loved tyranny only when disguised
      under the forms of constitutional liberty. He mixed up, after a fashion
      then not very unusual, the theories of the republicans of the seventeenth
      century with the technical maxims <span class="pagenum">55</span><a
      name="link55" id="link55"></a>of English law, and thus succeeded in
      combining anarchical speculation with arbitrary practice. The voice of the
      people was the voice of God; but the only legitimate organ through which
      the voice of the people could be uttered was the Parliament. All power was
      from the people; but to the Parliament the whole power of the people had
      been delegated. No Oxonian divine had ever, even in the years which
      immediately follow ed the Restoration, demanded for the King so abject, so
      unreasoning a homage, as Grenville on what he considered as the purest
      Whig principles, demanded for the Parliament. As he wished to see the
      Parliament despotic over the nation, so he wished to see it also despotic
      over the court. In his view the prime minister, possessed of the
      confidence of the House of Commons, ought to be Mayor of the Palace. The
      King was a mere Childeric or Chilperic, who might well think himself lucky
      in being permitted to enjoy such handsome apartments at St. James&rsquo;s, and
      so fine a park at Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the opinions of Bute and those of Grenville were diametrically
      opposed. Nor was there any private friendship between the two statesmen.
      Grenville&rsquo;s nature was not forgiving; and he well remembered how, a few
      months before, he had been compelled to yield the lead of the House of
      Commons to Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are inclined to think, on the whole, that the worst administration
      which has governed England since the Revolution was that of George
      Grenville. His public acts may be classed under two heads, outrages on the
      liberty of the people, and outrages on the dignity of the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by making war on the press. John Wilkes, member of Parliament for
      Aylesbury, was singled out <span class="pagenum">56</span><a name="link56"
       id="link56"></a>for persecution. Wilkes had, till very lately, been known
      chiefly as one of the most profane, licentious, and agreeable rakes about
      town. He was a man of taste, reading, and engaging manners. His sprightly
      conversation was the delight of green rooms and taverns, and pleased even
      grave hearers when he was sufficiently under restraint to abstain from
      detailing the particulars of his amours, and from breaking jests on the
      New Testament. His expensive debaucheries forced him to have recourse to
      the Jews. He was soon a ruined man, and determined to try his chance as a
      political adventurer. In parliament he did not succeed. His speaking,
      though pert, was feeble, and by no means interested his hearers so much as
      to make them forget his face, which was so hideous that the caricaturists
      were forced, in their own despite, to flatter him. As a writer, he made a
      better figure. He set up a weekly paper, called the North Briton. This
      journal, written with some pleasantry, and great, audacity and impudence,
      had a considerable number of readers. Forty-four numbers had been
      published when Bute resigned; and, though almost every number had
      contained matter grossly libellous, no prosecution had been instituted.
      The forty-fifth number was innocent when compared with the majority of
      those which had preceded it, and indeed contained nothing so strong as may
      in our time be found daily in the leading articles of the Times and
      Morning Chronicle. But Grenville was now at the head of affairs. A new
      spirit had been infused into the administration. Authority was to be
      upheld. The government was no longer to be braved with impunity. Wilkes
      was arrested under a general warrant, conveyed to the Tower, and confined
      there with circumstances of unusual severity. His papers were <span
      class="pagenum">57</span><a name="link57" id="link57"></a>seized, and
      carried to the Secretary of State. These harsh and illegal measures
      produced a violent outbreak of popular rage, which was soon changed to
      delight and exultation. The arrest was pronounced unlawful by the Court of
      Common Pleas, in which Chief Justice Pratt presided, and the prisoner was
      discharged. This victory over the government was celebrated with
      enthusiasm both in London and in the cider counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the ministers were daily becoming more odious to the nation, they
      were doing their best to make themselves also odious to the court. They
      gave the King plainly to understand that they were determined not to be
      Lord Bute&rsquo;s creatures, and exacted a promise that no secret adviser should
      have access to the royal ear. They soon found reason to suspect that this
      promise had not been observed. They remonstrated in terms less respectful
      than their master had been accustomed to hear, and gave him a fortnight to
      make his choice between his favourite and his cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      George the Third was greatly disturbed. He had but a few weeks before
      exulted in his deliverance from the yoke of the great Whig connection. He
      had even declared that his honour would not permit him ever again to admit
      the members of that connection into his service. He now found that he had
      only exchanged one set of masters for another set still harsher and more
      imperious. In his distress he thought on Pitt. From Pitt it was possible
      that better terms might be obtained than either from Grenville, or from
      the party of which Newcastle was the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grenville, on his return from an excursion into the country, repaired to
      Buckingham House. He was astonished to find at the entrance a chair, the
      shape of which <span class="pagenum">58</span><a name="link58" id="link58"></a>was
      well known to him, and indeed to all London. It was distinguished by a
      large boot, made for the purpose of accommodating the great Commoner&rsquo;s
      gouty leg. Grenville guessed the whole. His brother-in-law was closeted
      with the King. Bute, provoked by what he considered as the unfriendly and
      ungrateful conduct of his successors, had himself proposed that Pitt
      should be summoned to the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt had two audiences on two successive days. What passed at the first
      interview led him to expect that the negotiation would be brought to a
      satisfactory close; but on the morrow he found the King less complying.
      The best account, indeed the only trustworthy account of the conference,
      is that which was taken from Pitt&rsquo;s own mouth by Lord Hardwicke. It
      appears that Pitt strongly represented the importance of conciliating
      those chiefs of the Whig party who had been so unhappy as to incur the
      royal displeasure. They had, he said, been the most constant friends of
      the House of Hanover. Their power was great; they had been long versed in
      public business. If they were to be under sentence of exclusion, a solid
      administration could not be formed. His Majesty could not bear to think of
      putting himself into the hands of those whom he had recently chased from
      his court with the strongest marks of anger. &ldquo;I am sorry, Mr. Pitt,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;but I see this will not do. My honour is concerned. I must support
      my honour.&rdquo; How his Majesty succeeded in supporting his honour, we shall
      soon see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt retired, and the King was reduced to request the ministers, whom he
      had been on the point of discarding to remain in office. During the two
      years which followed, Grenville, now closely leagued with the <span
      class="pagenum">59</span><a name="link59" id="link59"></a>Bedfords, was
      the master of the court; and a hard master he proved. He knew that he was
      kept in place only because there was no choice except between himself and
      the Whigs. That under any circumstances the Whigs would be forgiven, he
      thought impossible. The late attempt to get rid of him had roused his
      resentment; the failure of that attempt had liberated him from all fear.
      He had never been very courtly. He now begun to hold a language, to which,
      since the days of Cornet Joyce and President Bradshaw, no English King had
      been compelled to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one matter, indeed, Grenville, at the expense of justice and liberty,
      gratified the passions of the court while gratifying his own. The
      persecution of Wilkes was eagerly pressed. He had written a parody on
      Pope&rsquo;s Essay on Man, entitled the Essay on Woman, and had appended to it
      notes, in ridicule of Waburton&rsquo;s famous Commentary. This composition was
      exceedingly profligate, but not more so, we think, than some of Pope&rsquo;s own
      works, the imitation of the second satire of the first book of Horace, for
      example; and, to do Wilkes justice, he had not, like Pope, given his
      ribaldry to the world. He had merely printed at a private press a very
      small number of copies, which he meant to present to some of his boon
      companions, whose morals were in no more danger of being corrupted by a
      loose book than a negro of being tanned by a warm sun. A tool of the
      government, by giving a bribe to the printer, procured a copy of this
      trash, and placed it in the hands of the ministers. The ministers resolved
      to visit Wilkes&rsquo;s offence against decorum with the utmost rigour of the
      law. What share piety and respect for morals had in dictating this
      resolution, our readers may judge from the fact that no person was more
      <span class="pagenum">60</span><a name="link60" id="link60"></a>eager for
      bringing the libertine poet to punishment than Lord March, afterwards Duke
      of Queensberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first day of the session of Parliament, the book, thus
      disgracefully obtained, was laid on the table of the Lords by the Earl of
      Sandwich, whom the Duke of Bedford&rsquo;s interest had made Secretary of State.
      The unfortunate author had not the slightest suspicion that his licentious
      poem had ever been seen, except by his printer and by a few of his
      dissipated companions, till it was produced in full Parliament. Though he
      was a man of easy temper, averse from danger, and not very susceptible of
      shame, the surprise, the disgrace, the prospect of utter ruin, put him
      beside himself. He picked a quarrel with one of Lord Bute&rsquo;s dependents,
      fought a duel, was seriously wounded, and when half recovered, fled to
      France. His enemies had now their own way both in the Parliament and in
      the King&rsquo;s Bench. He was censured, expelled from the House of Commons,
      outlawed. His works were ordered to be burned by the common hangman. Yet
      was the multitude still true to him. In the minds even of many moral and
      religious men, his crime seemed light when compared with the crime of his
      accusers. The conduct of Sandwich, in particular, excited universal
      disgust. His own vices were notorious; and, only a fortnight before he
      laid the Essay on Woman before the House of Lords, he had been drinking
      and singing loose catches with Wilkes at one of the most dissolute clubs
      in London. Shortly after the meeting of Parliament, the Beggar&rsquo;s Opera was
      acted at Covent Garden theatre. When Macheath uttered the words&mdash;&ldquo;That
      Jemmy Twitcher should peach me I own surprised me,&rdquo;&mdash;pit, boxes, and
      galleries, burst into a roar which seemed likely to bring the roof down.
    </p>
    <p>
      From <span class="pagenum">61</span><a name="link61" id="link61"></a>that
      day Sandwich was universally known by the nickname of Jemmy Twitcher. The
      ceremony of burning the North Briton was interrupted by a riot. The
      constables were beaten; the paper was rescued; and, instead of it, a jack
      boot and a petticoat were committed to the flames. Wilkes had instituted
      an action for the seizure of his papers against the Undersecretary of
      State. The jury gave a thousand pounds damages. But neither these nor any
      other indications of public feeling had power to move Grenville. He had
      the Parliament with him: and, according to his political creed, the sense
      of the nation was to be collected from the Parliament alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, however, he found reason to fear that even the Parliament might fail
      him. On the question of the legality of general warrants, the Opposition,
      having on its side all sound principles, all constitutional authorities,
      and the voice of the whole nation, mustered in great force, and was joined
      by many who did not ordinarily vote against the government. On one
      occasion the ministry, in a very full House, had a majority of only
      fourteen votes. The storm, however, blew over. The spirit of the
      Opposition, from whatever cause, began to flag at the moment when success
      seemed almost certain. The session ended without any change. Pitt, whose
      eloquence had shone with its usual lustre in all the principal debates,
      and whose popularity was greater than ever, was still a private man.
      Grenville, detested alike by the court and by the people, was still
      minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Houses had risen, Grenville took a step which proved, even
      more signally than any of his past acts, how despotic, how acrimonious,
      and how fearless his nature was. Among the gentlemen not ordinarily <span
      class="pagenum">62</span><a name="link62" id="link62"></a>opposed to the
      government, who, on the great constitutional question of general variants,
      had voted with the minority was Henry Conway, brother of the Earl of
      Hertford, a brave soldier, a tolerable speaker, and a well-meaning, though
      not a wise or vigorous politician, he was now deprived of his regiment,
      the merited reward of faithful and gallant service in two wars. It was
      confidently asserted that in this violent measure the King heartily
      concurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whatever pleasure the persecution of Wilkes, or the dismissal of
      Conway, may have given to the royal mind, it is certain that his Majesty&rsquo;s
      aversion to his ministers increased day by day. Grenville was as frugal of
      the public money as of his own, and morosely refused to accede to the
      King&rsquo;s request, that a few thousand pounds might be expended in buying
      some open fields to the west of the gardens of Buckingham House. In
      consequence of this refusal, the fields were soon covered with buildings,
      and the King and Queen were overlooked in their most private walks by the
      upper windows of a hundred houses. Nor was this the worst. Grenville was
      as liberal of words as he was sparing of guineas. Instead of explaining
      himself in that clear, concise, and lively manner, which alone could win
      the attention of a young mind new to business, he spoke in the closet just
      as he spoke in the House of Commons. When he had harangued two hours, he
      looked at his watch, as he had been in the habit of looking at the clock
      opposite the Speaker&rsquo;s chair, apologised for the length of his discourse,
      and then went on for an hour more. The members of the House of Commons can
      cough an orator down, or can walk away to dinner; and they were by no
      means sparing in the use of these privileges when Grenville was <span
      class="pagenum">63</span><a name="link63" id="link63"></a>on his legs. But
      the poor young King had to endure all this eloquence with mournful
      civility. To the end of his life he continued to talk with horror of
      Grenville&rsquo;s orations.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time took place one of the most singular events in Pitt&rsquo;s life.
      There was a certain Sir William Pynsent, a Somersetshire baronet of Whig
      politics, who had been a Member of the House of Commons in the days of
      Queen Anne, and had retired to rural privacy when the Tory party, towards
      the end of her reign, obtained the ascendency in her councils. His manners
      were eccentric. His morals lay under very odious imputations. But his
      fidelity to his political opinions was unalterable. During fifty years of
      seclusion he continued to brood over the circumstances which had driven
      him from public life, the dismissal of the Whigs, the peace of Utrecht,
      the desertion of our allies. He now thought that he perceived a close
      analogy between the well remembered events of his youth and the events
      which he had witnessed in extreme old age; between the disgrace of
      Marlborough and the disgrace of Pitt; between the elevation of Harley and
      the elevation of Bute; between the treaty negotiated by St. John and the
      treaty negotiated by Bedford; between the wrongs of the House of Austria
      in 1712 and the wrongs of the House of Brandenburgh in 1762.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fancy took such possession of the old man&rsquo;s mind that he determined
      to leave his whole property to Pitt. In this way Pitt unexpectedly came
      into possession of near three thousand pounds a year. Nor could all the
      malice of his enemies find any ground for reproach in the transaction.
      Nobody could call him a legacy hunter. Nobody could accuse him of seizing
      that to which others had a better claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <span class="pagenum">64</span><a name="link64" id="link64"></a>he had
      never in his life seen Sir William; and Sir William had left no relation
      so near as to be entitled to form any expectations respecting the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortunes of Pitt seemed to flourish; but his health was worse than
      ever. We cannot find that, during the session which began in January 1760,
      he once appeared in parliament. He remained some months in profound
      retirement at Hayes, his favourite villa, scarcely moving except from his
      armchair to his bed, and from his bed to his armchair, and often employing
      his wife as his amanuensis in his most confidential correspondence. Some
      of his detractors whispered that his invisibility was to be ascribed quite
      as much to affectation as to gout. In truth his character, high and
      splendid as it was, wanted simplicity. With genius which did not need the
      aid of stage tricks, and with a spirit which should have been far above
      them, he had yet been, through life, in the habit of practising them. It
      was, therefore, now surmised that, having acquired all the consideration
      which could be derived from eloquence and from great services to the
      state, he had determined not to make himself cheap by often appearing in
      public, but, under the pretext of ill health, to surround himself with
      mystery, to emerge only at long intervals and on momentous occasions, and
      at other times to deliver his oracles only to a few favoured votaries, who
      were suffered to make pilgrimages to his shrine. If such were his object,
      it was for a time fully attained. Never was the magic of his name so
      powerful, never was he regarded by his country with such superstitious
      veneration, as during this year of silence and seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Pitt was thus absent from Parliament, Grenville proposed a measure
      destined to produce a great revolution, <span class="pagenum">65</span><a
      name="link65" id="link65"></a>the effects of which will long be felt by
      the whole human race. We speak of the act for imposing stamp duties on the
      North American colonies. The plan was eminently characteristic of its
      author. Every feature of the parent was found in the child. A timid
      statesman would have shrunk from a step, of which Walpole, at a time when
      the colonies were far less powerful, had said&mdash;&ldquo;He who shall propose
      it will be a much bolder man than I.&rdquo; But the nature of Grenville was
      insensible to fear. A statesman of large views would have felt that to lay
      taxes at Westminster on New England and New York, was a course opposed,
      not indeed to the letter of the Statute Book, or to any decision contained
      in the Term Reports, but to the principles of good government, and to the
      spirit of the constitution. A statesman of large views would also have
      felt, that ten times the estimated produce of the American stamps would
      have been dearly purchased by even a transient quarrel between the mother
      country and the colonies. But Grenville knew of no spirit of the
      constitution distinct from the letter of the law, and of no national
      interests except those which are expressed by pounds, shillings, and
      pence. That his policy might give birth to deep discontents in all the
      provinces, from the shore of the Great Lakes to the Mexican sea; that
      France and Spain might seize the opportunity of revenge; that the empire
      might be dismembered; that the debt, that debt with the amount of which he
      perpetually reproached Pitt, might, in consequence of his own policy, be
      doubled; these were possibilities which never occurred to that small,
      sharp mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stamp Act will be remembered as long as the globe lasts. But, at the
      time, it attracted much less notice in this country than another Act which
      is now almost <span class="pagenum">66</span><a name="link66" id="link66"></a>utterly
      forgotten. The King fell ill, and was thought to be in a dangerous state.
      His complaint, we believe, was the same which, at a later period,
      repeatedly incapacitated him for the performance of his regal functions.
      The heir apparent was only two years old. It was clearly proper to make
      provision for the administration of the government, in case of a minority.
      The discussions on this point brought the quarrel between the court and
      the ministry to a crisis. The King wished to be intrusted with the power
      of naming a regent by will. The ministers feared, or affected to fear,
      that, if this power were conceded to him, he would name the Princess
      Mother, nay, possibly the Earl of Bute. They, therefore, insisted on
      introducing into the bill words confining the King&rsquo;s choice to the royal
      family. Having thus excluded Bute, they urged the King to let them, in the
      most marked manner, exclude the Princess Dowager also. They assured him
      that the House of Commons would undoubtedly strike her name out, and by
      this threat they wrung from him a reluctant assent. In a few days, it
      appeared that the representations by which they had induced the King to
      put this gross and public affront on his mother were unfounded. The
      friends of the Princess in the House of Commons moved that her name should
      be inserted. The ministers could not decently attack the parent of their
      master. They hoped that the Opposition would come to their help, and put
      on them a force to which they would gladly have yielded. But the majority
      of the Opposition, though hating the Princess, hated Grenville more,
      beheld his embarrassment with delight, and would do nothing to extricate
      him from it. The Princess&rsquo;s name was accordingly placed in the list of
      persons qualified to hold the regency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">67</span><a name="link67" id="link67"></a>King&rsquo;s
      resentment was now at the height. The present evil seemed to him more
      intolerable than any other. Even the junta of Whig grandees could not
      treat him worse than he had been treated by his present ministers. In his
      distress, he poured out his whole heart to his uncle, the Duke of
      Cumberland. The Duke was not a man to be loved; but he was eminently a man
      to be trusted. He had an intrepid temper, a strong understanding, and a
      high sense of honour and duty. As a general, he belonged to a remarkable
      class of captains, captains, we mean, whose fate it has been to lose
      almost all the battles which they have fought, and yet to be reputed stout
      and skilful soldiers. Such captains were Coligni and William the Third. We
      might, perhaps, add Marshal Soult to the list. The bravery of the Duke of
      Cumberland was such as distinguished him even among the princes of his
      brave house. The indifference with which he rode about amidst musket balls
      and cannon balls was not the highest proof of his fortitude. Hopeless
      maladies, horrible surgical operations, far from unmanning him, did not
      even discompose him. With courage, he had the virtues which are akin to
      courage. He spoke the truth, was open in enmity and friendship, and
      upright in all his dealings. But his nature was hard; and what seemed to
      him justice was rarely tempered with mercy. He was, therefore, during many
      years one of the most unpopular men in England. The severity with which he
      had treated the rebels after the battle of Culloden, had gained for him
      the name of the Butcher. His attempts to introduce into the army of
      England, then in a most disorderly state, the rigorous discipline of
      Potsdam, had excited still stronger disgust. Nothing was too bad to be
      believed of him. Many honest people were <span class="pagenum">68</span><a
      name="link68" id="link68"></a>so absurd as to fancy that, if he were left
      Regent during the minority of his nephews, there would be another
      smothering in the Tower. These feelings, however, had passed away. The
      Duke had been living, during some years, in retirement. The English, full
      of animosity against the Scots, now blamed his Royal Highness only for
      having left so many Camerons and Macphersons to be made gaugers and
      customhouse officers. He was, therefore, at present, a favourite with his
      countrymen, and especially with the inhabitants of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had little reason to love the King, and had shown clearly, though not
      obtrusively, his dislike of the system which had lately been pursued. But
      he had high and almost romantic notions of the duty which, as a prince of
      the blood, he owed to the head of his house. He determined to extricate
      his nephew from bondage, and to effect a reconciliation between the Whig
      party and the throne, on terms honourable to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this mind he set off for Hayes, and was admitted to Pitt&rsquo;s sick room;
      for Pitt would not leave his chamber, and would not communicate with any
      messenger of inferior dignity. And now began a long series of errors on
      the part of the illustrious statesman, errors which involved his country
      in difficulties and distresses more serious even than those from which his
      genius had formerly rescued her. His language was haughty, unreasonable,
      almost unintelligible. The only thing which could be discerned through a
      cloud of vague and not very gracious phrases, was that he would not at
      that moment take office. The truth, we believe, was this. Lord Temple, who
      was Pitt&rsquo;s evil genius, had just formed a new scheme of politics. Hatred
      of Bute and <span class="pagenum">69</span><a name="link69" id="link69"></a>of
      the Princess had, it should seem, taken entire possession of Temple&rsquo;s
      soul. He had quarrelled with his brother George, because George had been
      connected with Bute and the Princess. Now that George appeared to be the
      enemy of Bute and of the Princess, Temple was eager to bring about a
      general family reconciliation. The three brothers, as Temple, Grenville,
      and Pitt, were popularly called, might make a ministry, without leaning
      for aid either on Bute or on the Whig connection. With such views, Temple
      used all his influence to dissuade Pitt from acceding to the propositions
      of the Duke of Cumberland. Pitt was not convinced. But Temple had an
      influence over him such as no other person had ever possessed. They were
      very old friends, very near relations. If Pitt&rsquo;s talents and fame had been
      useful to Temple, Temple&rsquo;s purse had formerly, in times of great need,
      been useful to Pitt. They had never been parted in politics. Twice they
      had come into the cabinet together; twice they had left it together. Pitt
      could not bear to think of taking office without his chief ally. Yet he
      felt that he was doing wrong, that he was throwing away a great
      opportunity of serving his country. The obscure and unconciliatory style
      of the answers which he returned to the overtures of the Duke of
      Cumberland, may be ascribed to the embarrassment and vexation of a mind
      not at peace with itself. It is said that he mournfully exclaimed to
      Temple, <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"Extinxti te meque, soror,
      populumque, putresque <br /><span class="indent15">Siclonios, urbemque
      tuam.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The prediction was but too just.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding Pitt impracticable, the Duke of Cumberland advised the King to
      submit to necessity, and to keep Grenville and the Bedfords. It was,
      indeed, not a <span class="pagenum">70</span><a name="link70" id="link70"></a>time
      at which offices could safely be left vacant. The unsettled state of the
      government had produced a general relaxation through all the departments
      of the public service. Meetings, which at another time would have been
      harmless, now turned to riots, and rapidly rose almost to the dignity of
      rebellions. The Houses of Parliament were blockaded by the Spitalfields
      weavers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bedford House was assailed on all sides by a furious rabble, and was
      strongly garrisoned with horse and foot. Some people attributed these
      disturbances to the friends of Bute, and some to the friends of Wilkes.
      But, whatever might be the cause, the effect was general insecurity. Under
      such circumstances the King had no choice. With bitter feelings of
      mortification, he informed the ministers that he meant to retain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They answered by demanding from him a promise on his royal word never more
      to consult Lord Bute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promise was given. They then demanded something more. Lord Bute&rsquo;s
      brother, Mr. Mackenzie, held a lucrative office in Scotland. Mr. Mackenzie
      must be dismissed. The King replied that the office had been given under
      very peculiar circumstances, and that he had promised never to take it
      away while he lived. Grenville was obstinate; and the King, with a very
      bad grace, yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The session of Parliament was over. The triumph of the ministers was
      complete. The King was almost as much a prisoner as Charles the First had
      been, when in the Isle of Wight. Such were the fruits of the policy which,
      only a few months before, was represented as having for ever secured the
      throne against the dictation of insolent subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Majesty&rsquo;s natural resentment showed itself in every <span
      class="pagenum">71</span><a name="link71" id="link71"></a>look and word.
      In his extremity he looked wistfully towards that Whig connection, once
      the object of his dread and hatred. The Duke of Devonshire, who had been
      treated with such unjustifiable harshness, had lately died, and had been
      succeeded by his son, who was still a boy. The King condescended to
      express his regret for what had passed, and to invite the young Duke to
      court. The noble youth came, attended by his uncles, and was received with
      marked graciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This and many other symptoms of the same kind irritated the ministers.
      They had still in store for their sovereign an insult which would have
      provoked his grandfather to kick them out of the room. Grenville and
      Bedford demanded an audience of him, and read him a remonstrance of many
      pages, which they had drawn up with great care. His Majesty was accused of
      breaking his word, and of treating his advisers with gross unfairness. The
      Princess was mentioned in language by no means eulogistic. Hints were
      thrown out that Bute&rsquo;s head was in danger. The King was plainly told that
      he must not continue to show, as he had done, that he disliked the
      situation in which he was placed, that he must frown upon the Opposition,
      that he must carry it fair towards his ministers in public. He several
      times interrupted the reading, by declaring that he had ceased to hold any
      communication with Bute. But the ministers, disregarding his denial, went
      on; and the King listened in silence, almost choked by rage. When they
      ceased to read, he merely made a gesture expressive of his wish to be left
      alone. He afterwards owned that he thought he should have gone into a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven to despair, he again had recourse to the Duke of <span
      class="pagenum">72</span><a name="link72" id="link72"></a>Cumberland; and
      the Duke of Cumberland again had recourse to Pitt. Pitt was really
      desirous to undertake the direction of affairs, and owned, with many
      dutiful expressions, that the terms offered by the King were all that any
      subject could desire. But Temple was impracticable; and Pitt, with great
      regret, declared that he could not, without the concurrence of his
      brother-in-law, undertake the administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke now saw only one way of delivering his nephew. An administration
      must be formed of the Whigs in opposition, without Pitt&rsquo;s help. The
      difficulties seemed almost insuperable. Death and desertion had grievously
      thinned the ranks of the party lately supreme in the state. Those among
      whom the Duke&rsquo;s choice lay might be divided into two classes, nun too old
      for important offices, and men who had never been in any important office
      before. The cabinet must be composed of broken invalids or of raw
      recruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an evil, yet not an unmixed evil. If the new Whig statesmen had
      little experience in business and debate, they were, on the other hand,
      pure from the taint of that political immorality which had deeply infected
      their predecessors. Long prosperity had corrupted that great party which
      had expelled the Stuarts, limited the prerogatives of the Crown, and
      curbed the intolerance of the Hierarchy. Adversity had already produced a
      salutary effect. On the dav of the accession of George the Third, the
      ascendency of the Whig party terminated; and on that day the purification
      of the Whig party began. The rising chiefs of that party were men of a
      very different sort from Sandys and Wilmington, from Sir William Yonge and
      Henry Fox. They were men worthy to have charged by the side of Hampden
      <span class="pagenum">73</span><a name="link73" id="link73"></a>at
      Chalgrove, or to have exchanged the last embrace with Russell on the
      scaffold in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. They carried into politics the same high
      principles of virtue which regulated their private dealings, nor would
      they stoop to promote even the noblest and most salutary ends by means
      which honour and probity condemn. Such men were Lord John Cavendish, Sir
      George Savile, and others whom we hold in honour as the second founders of
      the Whig party, as the restorers of its pristine health and energy after
      half a century of degeneracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief of this respectable band was the Marquess of Rockingham, a man
      of splendid fortune, excellent sense, and stainless character. He was
      indeed nervous to such a degree that, to the very close of his life, he
      never rose without great reluctance and embarrassment to address the House
      of Lords. But, though not a great orator, he had in a high degree some of
      the qualities of a statesman. He chose his friends well; and he had, in an
      extraordinary degree, the art of attaching them to him by ties of the most
      honourable kind. The cheerful fidelity with which they adhered to him
      through many years of almost hopeless opposition was less admirable than
      the disinterestedness and delicacy which they showed when he rose to
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are inclined to think that the use and the abuse of party cannot be
      better illustrated than by a parallel between two powerful connections of
      that time, the Rockinghams and the Bedfords. The Rockingham party was, in
      our view, exactly what a party should be. It consisted of men bound
      together by common opinions, by common public objects, by mutual esteem.
      That they desired to obtain, by honest and constitutional means, the
      direction of affairs they openly avowed. <span class="pagenum">74</span><a
      name="link74" id="link74"></a>But, though often invited to accept the
      hon-oui&rsquo;s and emoluments of office, they steadily refused to do so on any
      conditions inconsistent with their principles. The Bedford party, as a
      party, had, as far as we can discover, no principle whatever. Rigby and
      Sandwich wanted public money, and thought that they should fetch a higher
      price jointly than singly. They therefore acted in concert, and prevailed
      on a much more important and a much better man than themselves to act with
      them.

    <p>
      It was to Rockingham that the Duke of Cumberland now had recourse. The
      Marquess consented to take the treasury. Newcastle, so long the recognized
      chief of the Whigs, could not well be excluded from the ministry. He was
      appointed keeper of the privy seal. A very honest clear-headed country
      gentleman, of the name of Dowdeswell, became Chancellor of the Exchequer.
      General Conway, who had served under the Duke of Cumberland, and was
      strongly attached to his royal highness, was made Secretary of State, with
      the lead in the House of Commons. A great Whig nobleman, in the prime of
      manhood, from whom much was at that time expected, Augustus Duke of
      Grafton, was the other Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oldest man living could remember no government so weak in oratorical
      talents and in official experience. The general opinion was, that the
      ministers might hold office during the recess, but that the first day of
      debate in Parliament would be the last day of their power. Charles
      Townshend was asked what he thought of the new administration. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;mere lutestring; pretty summer wear. It will never do for the
      winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this conjuncture Lord Rockingham had the wisdom <span class="pagenum">75</span><a
      name="link75" id="link75"></a>to discern the value, and secure the aid, of
      an ally, who, to eloquence surpassing the eloquence of Pitt, and to
      industry which shamed the industry of Grenville, united an amplitude of
      comprehension to which neither Pitt nor Grenville could lay claim. A young
      Irishman had, some time before, come over to push his fortune in London.
      He had written much for the booksellers; but he was best known by a little
      treatise, in which the style and reasoning of Bolingbroke were mimicked
      with exquisite skill, and by a theory, of more ingenuity than soundness,
      touching the pleasures which we receive from the objects of taste. He had
      also attained a high reputation as a talker, and was regarded by the men
      of letters who supped together at the Turk&rsquo;s Head as the only match in
      conversation for Dr. Johnson. He now became private secretary to Lord
      Rockingham, and was brought into Parliament by his patron&rsquo;s influence.
      These arrangements, indeed, were not made without some difficulty. The
      Duke of Newcastle, who was always meddling and chattering, adjured the
      first lord of the treasury to be on his guard against this adventurer,
      whose real name was O&rsquo;Rourke, and whom his grace knew to be a wild
      Irishman, a Jacobite, a Papist, a concealed Jesuit. Lord Rockingham
      treated the calumny as it deserved; and the Whig party was strengthened
      and adorned by the accession of Edmund Burke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party, indeed, stood in need of accessions; for it sustained about
      this time an almost irreparable loss. The Duke of Cumberland had formed
      the government, and was its main support. His exalted rank and great name
      in some degree balanced the fame of Pitt. As mediator between the Whigs
      and the Court, he held a place <span class="pagenum">76</span><a
      name="link76" id="link76"></a>which no other person could fill. The
      strength of his character supplied that which was the chief defect of the
      new ministry. Conway, in particular, who, with excellent intentions and
      respectable talents, was the most dependent, and irresolute of human
      bennes, drew from the counsels of that masculine mind a determination not
      his own. Before the meeting of Parliament the Duke suddenly died. His
      death was generally regarded as the signal of great troubles, and on this
      account, as well as from respect for his personal qualities, was greatly
      lamented. It was remarked that the mourning in London was the most general
      ever known, and wars both deeper and longer than the Gazette had
      prescribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, every mail from America brought alarming tidings. The
      crop which Grenville had sown his successors had now to reap. The colonies
      were in a state bordering on rebellion. The stamps were burned. The
      revenue officers were tarred and feathered. All traffic between the
      discontented provinces and the mother country was interrupted. The
      Exchange of London was in dismay. Half the firms of Bristol and Liverpool
      were threatened with bankruptcy. In Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, it was
      said that three artisans out of every ten had been turned adrift. Civil
      war seemed to be at hand; and it could not be doubted that, if once the
      British nation were divided against itself, France and Spain would soon
      take part in the quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three courses were open to the ministers. The first was to enforce the
      Stamp Act by the sword. This was the course on which the King, and
      Grenville, whom the King hated beyond all living men, were alike bent. The
      natures of both were arbitrary and stubborn. <span class="pagenum">77</span><a
      name="link77" id="link77"></a>They resembled each other so much that they
      could never be friends; but they resembled each other also so much that
      they saw almost all important practical questions in the same point of
      view. Neither of them would bear to be governed by the other; but they
      were perfectly agreed as to the best way of governing the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another course was that which Pitt recommended. He held that the British
      Parliament was not constitutionally competent to pass a law for taxing the
      colonies. He therefore considered the Stamp Act as a nullity, as a
      document of no more validity than Charles&rsquo;s writ of shipmoney, or James&rsquo;s
      proclamation dispensing with the penal laws. This doctrine seems to us, we
      must own, to be altogether untenable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between these extreme courses lay a third way. The opinion of the most
      judicious and temperate statesmen of those times was that the British
      constitution had set no limit whatever to the legislative power of the
      British King, Lords, and Commons, over the whole British Empire.
      Parliament, they held, was legally competent to tax America, as Parliament
      was legally competent to commit any other act of folly or wickedness, to
      confiscate the property of all the merchants in Lombard Street, or to
      attaint any man in the kingdom of high treason, without examining
      witnesses against him, or hearing him in his own defence. The most
      atrocious act of confiscation or of attainder is just as valid an act as
      the Toleration Act or the Habeas Corpus Act. But from acts of confiscation
      and acts of attainder lawgivers are bound, by every obligation of
      morality, systematically to refrain. In the same manner ought the British
      legislature to refrain from taxing the American colonies. The Stamp Act
      <span class="pagenum">78</span><a name="link78" id="link78"></a>was
      indefensible, not because it was beyond the constitutional competence of
      Parliament, but because it was unjust and impolitic, sterile of revenue,
      and fertile of discontents. These sound doctrines were adopted by Lord
      Rockingham and his colleagues, and were, during a long course of years,
      inculcated by Burke, in orations, some of which will last as long as the
      English language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter came; the Parliament met; and the state of the colonies
      instantly became the subject of fierce contention. Pitt, whose health had
      been somewhat restored by the waters of Bath, reappeared in the House of
      Commons, and, with ardent and pathetic eloquence, not only condemned the
      Stamp Act, but applauded the resistance of Massachusetts and Virginia, and
      vehemently maintained, in defiance, we must say, of all reason and of all
      authority, that, according to the British constitution, the supreme
      legislative power does not include the power to tax. The language of
      Grenville, on the other hand, was such as Strafford might have used at the
      council table of Charles the First, when news came of the resistance to
      the liturgy at Edinburgh. The colonists were traitors; those who excused
      them were little better. Frigates, mortars, bayonets, sabres, were the
      proper remedies for such distempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ministers occupied an intermediate position; they proposed to declare
      that the legislative authority of the British Parliament over the whole
      Empire was in all cases supreme; and they proposed, at the same time, to
      repeal the Stamp Act. To the former measure Pitt objected; but it was
      carried with scarcely a dissentient voice. The repeal of the Stamp Act
      Pitt strongly supported; but against the Government was arrayed <span
      class="pagenum">79</span><a name="link79" id="link79"></a>a formidable
      assemblage of opponents. Grenville and the Bedfords were furious. Temple,
      who had now allied himself closely with his brother, and separated himself
      from Pitt, was no despicable enemy. This, however, was not the worst. The
      ministry was without its natural strength. It had to struggle, not only
      against its avowed enemies, but against the insidious hostility of the
      King, and of a set of persons who, about this time, began to be designated
      as the King&rsquo;s friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character of this faction has been drawn by Burke with even more than
      his usual force and vivacity. Those who know how strongly, through his
      whole life, his judgment was biassed by his passions, may not unnaturally
      suspect that he has left us rather a caricature than a likeness; and yet
      there is scarcely, in the whole portrait, a single touch of which the
      fidelity is not proved by facts of unquestionable authenticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public generally regarded the King&rsquo;s friends as a body of which Bute
      was the directing soul. It was to no purpose that the Earl professed to
      have done with politics, that he absented himself year after year from the
      levee and the drawing-room, that he went to the north, that he went to
      Rome. The notion that, in some inexplicable manner, he dictated all the
      measures of the court, was fixed in the minds, not only of the multitude,
      but of some who had good opportunities of obtaining information, and who
      ought to have been superior to vulgar prejudices. Our own belief is that
      these suspicions were unfounded, and that he ceased to have any
      communication with the King on political matters some time before the
      dismissal of George Grenville. The supposition of Bute&rsquo;s influence is,
      indeed, by <span class="pagenum">80</span><a name="link80" id="link80"></a>no
      means necessary to explain the phænomena. The King in 1765, was no longer
      the ignorant and inexperienced boy who had, in 1760, been managed by his
      mother and his Groom of the Stole. He had, during several years, observed
      the struggles of parties, and conferred daily on high questions of state
      with able and experienced politicians. His way of life had developed his
      understanding and character. He was now no longer a puppet, but had very
      decided opinions both of men and things. Nothing could be more natural
      than that he should have high notions of his own prerogatives, should be
      impatient of opposition, and should wish all public men to be detached
      from each other and dependent on himself alone; nor could anything be more
      natural than that, in the state in which the political world then was, he
      should find instruments fit for his purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus sprang into existence and into note a reptile species of politicians
      never before and never since known in our country. These men disclaimed
      all political ties, except those which bound them to the throne. They were
      willing to coalesce with any party, to abandon any party, to undermine any
      party, to assault any party, at a moment&rsquo;s notice. To them, all
      administrations, and all oppositions were the same. They regarded Bute,
      Grenville, Rockingham, Pitt, without one sentiment either of predilection
      or of aversion. They were the Kings friends. It is to be observed that
      this friendship implied no personal intimacy. These people had never lived
      with their master as Dodington at one time lived with his father, or as
      Sheridan afterwards lived with his son. They never hunted with him in the
      morning, or played cards with him in the evening, never shared his mutton
      or walked <span class="pagenum">81</span><a name="link81" id="link81"></a>with
      him among his turnips. Only one or two of them ever saw his face, except
      on public days. The whole band, however, always had early and accurate
      information as to his personal inclinations. These people were never high
      in the administration. They were generally to be found in places of much
      emolument, little labour, and no responsibility; and these places they
      continued to occupy securely while the cabinet was six or seven times
      reconstructed. Their peculiar business was not to support the ministry
      against the opposition, but to support the King against the ministry.
      Whenever his Majesty was induced to give a reluctant assent to the
      introduction of some bill which his constitutional advisers regarded as
      necessary, his friends in the House of Commons were sure to speak against
      it, to vote against it, to throw in its way every obstruction compatible
      with the forms of Parliament. If his Majesty found it necessary to admit
      into his closet a Secretary of State or a First Lord of the Treasury whom
      he disliked, his friends were sure to miss no opportunity of thwarting and
      humbling the obnoxious minister. In return for these services, the King
      covered them with his protection. It was to no purpose that his
      responsible servants complained to him that they were daily betrayed and
      impeded by men who were eating the bread of the government. He sometimes
      justified the offenders, sometimes excused them, sometimes owned that they
      were to blame, but said that he must take time to consider whether he
      could part with them. He never would turn them out; and, while every thing
      else in the state was constantly changing, these sycophants seemed to have
      a life estate in their offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <span class="pagenum">82</span><a name="link82" id="link82"></a>was
      well known to the King&rsquo;s friends that, though his Majesty had consented to
      the repeal of Stamp Aet, he had consented with a very bad grace, and that
      though he had eagerly welcomed the Whigs, when, in his extreme need and at
      his earnest entreaty, they had undertaken to free him from an
      insupportable yoke, he had by no means got over his early prejudices
      against his deliverers. The ministers soon found that, while they were
      encountered in front by the whole force of a strong opposition, their rear
      was assailed by a large body of those whom they had regarded as
      auxiliaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Lord Rockingham and his adherents went on resolutely with
      the bill for repealing the Stamp Act. They had on their side all the
      manufacturing and commercial interests of the realm. In the debates the
      government was powerfully supported. Two great orators and statesmen,
      belonging to two different generations, repeatedly put forth all their
      powers in defence of the bill. The House of Commons heard Pitt for the
      last time, and Burke for the first time, and was in doubt to which of them
      the palm of eloquence should be assigned. It was indeed a splendid sunset
      and a splendid dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the event seemed doubtful. In several divisions the ministers
      were hard pressed. On one occasion, not less than twelve of the King&rsquo;s
      friends, all men in office, voted against the government. It was to no
      purpose that Lord Rockingham remonstrated with the King. His Majesty
      confessed that there was ground for complaint, but hoped that gentle means
      would bring the mutineers to a better mind. If they persisted in their
      misconduct, he would dismiss them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the decisive day arrived. The gallery, the lobby, the Court of
      Requests, the staircases, were crowded <span class="pagenum">83</span><a
      name="link83" id="link83"></a>with merchants from all the great ports of
      the island. The debate lasted till long after midnight. On the division
      the ministers had a great majority. The dread of civil war, and the outcry
      of all the trading towns of the kingdom, had been too strong for the
      combined strength of the court and the opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the first dim twilight of a February morning that the doors were
      thrown open, and that the chiefs of the hostile parties showed themselves
      to the multitude. Conway was received with loud applause. But, when Pitt
      appeared, all eyes were fixed on him alone. All hats were in the air. Loud
      and long huzzas accompanied him to his chair, and a train of admirers
      escorted him all the way to his home. Then came forth Grenville. As soon
      as he was recognised, a storm of hisses and curses broke forth. He turned
      fiercely on the crowd, and caught one man by the throat. The bystanders
      were in great alarm. If a scuffle began, none could say how it might end.
      Fortunately the person who had been collared only said, &ldquo;If I may not
      hiss, sir, I hope I may laugh,&rdquo; and laughed in Grenville&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority had been so decisive, that all the opponents of the ministry,
      save one, were disposed to let the bill pass without any further
      contention. But solicitation and expostulation were thrown away on
      Grenville.
    </p>
    <p>
      His indomitable spirit rose up stronger and stronger under the load of
      public hatred. He fought out the battle obstinately to the end. On the
      last reading he had a sharp altercation with his brother-in-law, the last
      of their many sharp altercations. Pitt thundered in his loftiest tones
      against the man who had wished to dip the ermine of a British King in the
      blood of the British people. Grenville replied with his wonted intrepidity
      <span class="pagenum">84</span><a name="link84" id="link84"></a>and
      asperity. &ldquo;If the tax,&rdquo;&rsquo; he said, &ldquo;were still to be laid on, I would lay
      it on. For the evils which it may produce my accuser is answerable. His
      profusion made it necessary. His declarations against the constitutional
      powers of Kings, Lords, and Commons, have made it doubly necessary. I do
      not envy him the huzza. I glory in the hiss. If it were to be done again,
      I would do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The repeal of the Stamp Act was the chief measure of Lord Rockingham&rsquo;s
      government. But that government is entitled to the praise of having put a
      stop to two oppressive practices, which, in Wilkes&rsquo;s case, had attracted
      the notice and excited the just indignation of the public. The House of
      Commons was induced by the ministers to pass a resolution condemning the
      use of general warrants, and another resolution condemning the seizure of
      papers in cases of libel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be added, to the lasting honour of Lord Rockingham, that his
      administration was the first which, during a long course of years, had the
      courage and the virtue to refrain from bribing members of Parliament. His
      enemies accused him and his friends of weakness, of haughtiness, of party
      spirit; but calumny itself never dared to couple his name with corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily his government, though one of the best that has ever existed in
      our country, was also one of the weakest. The King&rsquo;s friends assailed and
      obstructed the ministers at every turn. To appeal to the King was only to
      draw forth new promises and new evasions. His Majesty was sure that there
      must be some misunderstanding. Lord Rockingham had better speak to the
      gentlemen. They should be dismissed on the next fault. The next fault was
      soon committed, and his Majesty <span class="pagenum">85</span><a
      name="link85" id="link85"></a>still continued to shuffle. It was too bad.
      It was quite abominable; but it mattered less as the prorogation was at
      hand. He would give the delinquents one more chance. If they did not alter
      their conduct next session, he should not have one word to say for them.
      He had already resolved that, long before the commencement of the next
      session, Lord Rockingham should cease to be minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now come to a part of our story which, admiring as we do the
      genius and the many noble qualities of Pitt, we cannot relate without much
      pain. We believe that, at this conjuncture, he had it in his power to give
      the victory either to the Whigs or to the King&rsquo;s friends. If he had allied
      himself closely with Lord Rockingham, what could the court have done?
      There would have been only one alternative, the Whigs or Grenville; and
      there conld be no doubt what the King&rsquo;s choice woidd be. He still
      remembered, as well he might, with the uttermost bitterness, the thraldom
      from which his uncle had freed him, and said about this time, with great
      vehemence, that he would sooner see the Devil come into his closet than
      Grenville.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was there to prevent Pitt from allying himself with Lord
      Rockingham? On all the most important questions their views were the same.
      They had agreed in condemning the peace, the Stamp Act, the general
      warrant, the seizure of papers. The points on which they differed were few
      and unimportant. In integrity, in disinterestedness, in hatred of
      corruption, they resembled each other. Their personal interests could not
      clash. They sat in different Houses, and Pitt had always declared that
      nothing should induce him to be first lord of the treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the opportunity of forming a coalition beneficial to <span
      class="pagenum">86</span><a name="link86" id="link86"></a>the state, and
      honourable to all concerned, was suffered to escape, the fault was not
      with the Whig ministers. They behaved towards Pitt with an obsequiousness
      which, had it not been the effect of sincere admiration and of anxiety for
      the public interests, might have been justly called servile. They
      repeatedly gave him to understand that, if he chose to join their ranks,
      they were ready to receive him, not as an associate, but as a leader. They
      had proved their respect for him by bestowing a peerage on the person who,
      at that time, enjoyed the largest share of his confidence, Chief Justice
      Pratt. What then was there to divide Pitt from the Whigs? What, on the
      other hand, was there in common between him and the King&rsquo;s friends, that
      he should lend himself to their purposes, he who had never owed any thing
      to flattery or intrigue, he whose eloquence and independent spirit had
      overawed two generations of slaves and jobbers, he who had twice been
      forced by the enthusiasm of an admiring nation on a reluctant Prince?
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily the court had gained Pitt, not, it is true, by those ignoble
      means which were employed when such men as Rigby and Wedderburn were to be
      won, but by allurements suited to a nature noble even in its aberrations.
      The King set himself to seduce the one man who could turn the Whigs out
      without letting Grenville in. Praise, caresses, promises, were lavished on
      the idol of the nation. He, and he alone, could put an end to fiction,
      could bid defiance to all the powerful connections in the land united,
      Whigs and Tories, Rockinghams, Bedfords, and Grenvilles. These
      blandishments produced a great effect. For though Pitt&rsquo;s spirit was high
      and manly, though his eloquence was often exerted with formidable effect
      against the court, <span class="pagenum">87</span><a name="link87"
       id="link87"></a>and though his theory of government had been learned in
      the school of Locke and Sydney, he had always regarded the person of the
      sovereign with profound veneration. As soon as he was brought face to face
      with royalty, his imagination and sensibility were too strong for his
      principles. His Whiggism thawed and disappeared; and he became, for the
      time, a Tory of the old Ormond pattern. Nor was he by any means unwilling
      to assist in the work of dissolving all political connections. His own
      weight in the state was wholly independent of such connections. He was
      therefore inclined to look on them with dislike, and made far too little
      distinction between gangs of knaves associated for the mere purpose of
      robbing the public, and confederacies of honourable men for the promotion
      of great public objects. Nor had he the sagacity to perceive that the
      strenuous efforts which he made to annihilate all parties tended only to
      establish the ascendency of one party, and that the basest and most
      hateful of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be doubted whether he would have been thus misled, if his mind had
      been in full health and vigour. But the truth is that he had for some time
      been in an unnatural state of excitement. No suspicion of this sort had
      yet got abroad. His eloquence had never shone with more splendour than
      during the recent debates. But people afterwards called to mind many
      things which ought to have roused their apprehensions. His habits were
      gradually becoming more and more eccentric. A horror of all loud sounds,
      such as is said to have been one of the many oddities of Wallenstein, grew
      upon him. Though the most affectionate of fathers, he could not at this
      time bear to hear the voices of his own children, and laid out great <span
      class="pagenum">88</span><a name="link88" id="link88"></a>sums at Hayes in
      buying up houses contiguous to his own, merely that he might have no
      neighbours to disturb him with their noise. He then sold Hayes, and took
      possession of a villa at Hampstead, where he again began to purchase
      houses to right and left. In expense, indeed, he vied, during this part of
      his life, with the wealthiest of the conquerors of Bengal and Tanjore. At
      Burton Pynsent, he ordered a great extent of ground to be planted with
      cedars. Cedars enough for the purpose were not to be found in
      Somersetshire. They were therefore collected in London, and sent down by
      land carriage. Relays of labourers were hired; and the work went on all
      night by torchlight. No man could be more abstemious than Pitt: yet the
      profusion of his kitchen was a wonder even to epicures. Several dinners
      were always dressing; for his appetite was capricious and fanciful; and at
      whatever moment he felt inclined to eat, he expected a meal to be
      instantly on the table. Other circumstances might be mentioned, such as
      separately are of little moment, but such as, when taken together, and
      when viewed in connection with the strange events which followed, justify
      us in believing that his mind was already in a morbid state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the close of the session of Parliament, Lord Rockingham
      received his dismissal. He retired, accompanied by a firm body of friends,
      whose consistency and uprightness enmity itself was forced to admit. None
      of them had asked or obtained any pension or any sinecure, either in
      possession or in reversion. Such disinterestedness was then rare among
      politicians. Their chief, though not a man of brilliant talents, had won
      for himself an honourable fame, which he kept pure to the last. He had, in
      spite of difficulties which seemed <span class="pagenum">89</span><a
      name="link89" id="link89"></a>almost insurmountable, removed great abuses
      and averted a civil war. Sixteen years later, in a dark and terrible day,
      he was again called upon to save the state, brought to the very brink of
      ruin by the same perfidy and obstinacy which had embarrassed, and at
      length overthrown, his first administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt was planting in Somersetshire when he was summoned to court by a
      letter written by the royal hand. He instantly hastened to London. The
      irritability of his mind and body were increased by the rapidity with
      which he travelled; and when he reached his journey&rsquo;s end he was suffering
      from fever. Ill as he was, he saw the King at Richmond, and undertook to
      form an administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt was scarcely in the state in which a man should be who has to conduct
      delicate and arduous negotiations. In his letters to his wife, he
      complained that the conferences in which it was necessary for him to bear
      a part heated his blood and accelerated his pulse. From other sources of
      information we learn, that his language, even to those whose co-operation
      he wished to engage, was strangely peremptory and despotic. Some of his
      notes written at this time have been preserved, and are in a style which
      Lewis the Fourteenth would have been too well bred to employ in addressing
      any French gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the attempt to dissolve all parties, Pitt met with some difficulties.
      Some Whigs, whom the court would gladly have detached from Lord
      Rockingham, rejected all offers. The Bedfords were perfectly willing to
      break with Grenville; but Pitt would not come up to their terms. Temple,
      whom Pitt at first meant to place at the head of the treasury, proved
      intractable. A coldness indeed had, during some months, been fast growing
      <span class="pagenum">90</span><a name="link90" id="link90"></a>between
      the brothers-in-law, so long and so closely allied in politics. Pitt was
      angry with Temple for opposing the repeal of the Stamp Act. Temple was
      angry with Pitt for refusing to accede to that family league which was now
      the favorite plan at Stowe. At length the Earl proposed an equal partition
      of power and patronage, and offered, on this condition, to give up his
      brother George. Pitt thought the demand exorbitant, and positively refused
      compliance. A bitter quarrel followed. Each of the kinsmen was true to his
      character. Temple&rsquo;s soul festered with spite, and Pitt&rsquo;s swelled into
      contempt. Temple represented Pitt as the most odious of hypocrites and
      traitors. Pitt held a different and perhaps a more provoking tone. Temple
      was a good sort of man enough, whose single title to distinction was, that
      he had a large garden, with a large piece of water, and a great many
      pavilions and summer-houses. To his fortunate connection with a great,
      orator and statesman he was indebted for an importance in the state which
      his own talents could never have gained for him. That importance had
      turned his head. He had begun to fancy that he could form administrations,
      and govern empires. It was piteous to see a well meaning man under such a
      delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all these difficulties, a ministry was made such as the King
      wished to see, a ministry in which all his Majesty&rsquo;s friends were
      comfortably accommodated, and which, with the exception of his Majesty&rsquo;s
      friends, contained no four persons who had ever in their lives been in the
      habit of acting together. Men who had never concurred in a single vote
      found themselves seated at the same board. The office of paymaster was
      divided between two persons who had never <span class="pagenum">91</span><a
      name="link91" id="link91"></a>exchanged a word. Most of the chief posts
      were filled either by personal adherents of Pitt, or by members of the
      late ministry, who had been induced to remain in place after the dismissal
      of Lord Rockingham. To the former class belonged Pratt, now Lord Camden,
      who accepted the great seal, and Lord Shelburne, who was made one of the
      Secretaries of State. To the latter class belonged the Duke of Grafton,
      who became First Lord of the Treasury, and Conway, who kept his old
      position both in the government and in the House of Commons. Charles
      Townshend, who had belonged to every party, and cared for none, was
      Chancellor of the Exchequer. Pitt himself was declared prime minister, but
      refused to take any laborious office. He was created Earl of Chatham, and
      the privy seal was delivered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to say, that the failure, the complete and
      disgraceful failure, of this arrangement, is not to be ascribed to any
      want of capacity in the persons whom we have named. None of them was
      deficient in abilities; and four of them, Pitt himself, Shelburne, Camden,
      and Townshend, were men of high intellectual eminence. The fault was not
      in the materials, but in the principle on which the materials were put
      together. Pitt had mixed up these conflicting elements, in the full
      confidence that he should be able to keep them all in perfect
      subordination to himself, and in perfect harmony with each other. We shall
      soon see how the experiment succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very day on which the new prime minister kissed hands, three
      fourths of that popularity which he had long enjoyed without a rival, and
      to which he owed the greater part of his authority, departed from him. A
      violent outcry was raised, not against that part <span class="pagenum">92</span><a
      name="link92" id="link92"></a>of his conduct which really deserved severe
      condemnation, but against a step in which we can see nothing to censure.
      His acceptance of a peerage produced a general burst of indignation. Yet
      surely no peerage had ever been better earned; nor was there ever a
      statesman who more needed the repose of the Upper House. Pitt was now
      growing old. He was much older in constitution than in years. It was with
      imminent risk to his life that he had, on some important occasions,
      attended his duty in Parliament. During the session of 1764, he had not
      been able to take part in a single debate. It was impossible that he
      should go through the nightly labour of conducting the business of the
      government in the House of Commons. His wish to be transferred, under such
      circumstances, to a less busy and a less turbulent assembly,-was natural
      and reasonable. The nation, however, overlooked all these considerations.
      Those who had most loved and honoured the great Commoner were loudest in
      invective against the new made Lord. London had hitherto been true to him
      through every vicissitude. When the citizens learned that he had been sent
      for from Somersetshire, that he had been closeted with the King at
      Richmond, and that he was to be first minister, they had been in
      transports of joy. Preparations were made for a grand entertainment and
      for a general illumination. The lamps had actually been placed round the
      monument, when the Gazette announced that the object of all this
      enthusiasm was an Earl. Instantly the feast was countermanded. The lamps
      were taken down. The newspapers raised the roar of obloquy. Pamphlets,
      made up of calumny and scurrility, filled the shops of all the
      booksellers; and of those pamphlets, the most galling were written under
      <span class="pagenum">93</span><a name="link93" id="link93"></a>the
      direction of the malignant Temple. It was now the fashion to compare the
      two Williams, William Pulteney and William Pitt. Both, it was said, had,
      by eloquence and simulated patriotism, acquired a great ascendency in the
      House of Commons and in the country. Both had been intrusted with the
      office of reforming the government. Both had, when at the height of power
      and popularity, been seduced by the splendour of the coronet. Both had
      been made earls, and both had at once become objects of aversion and scorn
      to the nation which a few hours before had regarded them with affection
      and veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clamour against Pitt appears to have had a serious effect on the
      foreign relations of the country. His name had till now acted like a spell
      at Versailles and Saint Ildefonso. English travellers on the Continent had
      remarked that nothing more was necessary to silence a whole room full of
      boasting Frenchmen than to drop a hint of the probability that Mr. Pitt
      would return to power. In an instant there was deep silence: all shoulders
      rose, and all faces were lengthened. Now, unhappily, every foreign court,
      in learning that he was recalled to office, learned also that he no longer
      possessed the hearts of his countrymen. Ceasing to be loved at home, he
      ceased to be feared abroad. The name of Pitt had been a charmed name. Our
      envoys tried in vain to conjure with the name of Chatham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulties which beset Chatham were daily increased by the despotic
      manner in which he treated all around him. Lord Rockingham had, at the
      time of the change of ministry, acted with great moderation, had expressed
      a hope that the new government would act on the principles of the late
      government, and had even interfered to prevent many of his friends from
      quitting <span class="pagenum">94</span><a name="link94" id="link94"></a>office.
      Thus Saunders and Keppel, two naval commanders of great eminence, had been
      induced to remain at the Admiralty, where their services were much needed.
      The Duke of Portland was still Lord Chamberlain, and Lord Besborough
      Postmaster. But within a quarter of a year, Lord Chatham had so deeply
      affronted these men, that they all retired in disgust. In truth, his tone,
      submissive in the closet, was at this time insupportably tyrannical in the
      cabinet. His colleagues were merely his clerks for naval, financial, and
      diplomatic business. Conway, meek as he was, was on one occasion provoked
      into declaring that such language as Lord Chatham&rsquo;s had never been heard
      west of Constantinople, and was with difficulty prevented by Horace
      Walpole from resigning, and rejoining the standard of Lord Rockingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breach which had been made in the government by the defection of so
      many of the Rockinghams, Chatham hoped to supply by the help of the
      Bedfords. But with the Bedfords he could not deal as he had dealt with
      other parties. It was to no purpose that he bade high for one or two
      members of the faction, in the hope of detaching them from the rest. They
      were to be had; but they were to be had only in the lot. There was indeed
      for a moment some wavering and some disputing among them. But at length
      the counsels of the shrewd and resolute Rigby prevailed. They determined
      to stand firmly together, and plainly intimated to Chatham that he must
      take them all, or that he should get none of them. The event proved that
      they were wiser in their generation than any other connection in the
      state. In a few months they were able to dictate their own terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important public measure of Lord Chatham&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">95</span><a
      name="link95" id="link95"></a>administration was his celebrated
      interference with the corn trade. The harvest had been bad; the price of
      food was high; and he thought it necessary to take on himself the
      responsibility of laying an embargo on the exportation of grain. When
      Parliament met, this proceeding was attacked by the opposition as
      unconstitutional, and defended by the ministers as indispensably
      necessary. At last an act was passed to indemnify all who had been
      concerned in the embargo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first words uttered by Chatham, in the House of Lords, were in defence
      of his conduct on this occasion. He spoke with a calmness, sobriety, and
      dignity, well suited to the audience which he was addressing. A subsequent
      speech which he made on the same subject was less successful. He bade
      defiance to aristocratical connections, with a superciliousness to which
      the Peers were not accustomed, and with tones and gestures better suited
      to a large and stormy assembly than to the body of which he was now a
      member. A short altercation followed, and he was told very plainly that he
      should not be suffered to browbeat the old nobility of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gradually became clearer and clearer that he was in a distempered state
      of mind. His attention had been drawn to the territorial acquisitions of
      the East India Company, and he determined to bring the whole of that great
      subject before Parliament. He would not, however, confer on the subject
      with any of his colleagues. It was in vain that Conway, who was charged
      with the conduct of business in the House of Commons, and Charles
      Townshend, who was responsible for the direction of the finances, begged
      for some glimpse of light as to what was in contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatham&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">96</span><a name="link96" id="link96"></a>answers
      were sullen and mysterious. He must decline any discussion with them; he
      did not want their assistance; he had fixed on a person to take charge of
      his measure in the House of Commons. This person was a member who was not
      connected with the government, and who neither had, nor deserved to have,
      the ear of the House, a noisy, purse-proud, illiterate demagogue, whose
      Cockney English and scraps of mispronounced Latin were the jest of the
      newspapers, Alderman Beckford. It may well be supposed that these strange
      proceedings produced a ferment through the whole political world. The city
      was in commotion. The East India Company invoked the faith of charters.
      Burke thundered against the minis-tors. The ministers looked at each
      other, and knew not what to say. In the midst of the confusion, Lord
      Chatham proclaimed himself gouty, and retired to Bath. It was announced,
      after some time, that he was better, that he would shortly return, that he
      would soon put every thing in order. A day was fixed for his arrival in
      London. But when he reached the Castle inn at Marlborough, he stopped,
      shut himself up in his room, and remained there some weeks. Every body who
      travelled that road was amazed by the number of his attendants. Footmen
      and grooms, dressed in his family livery, filled the whole inn, though one
      of the largest in England, and Swarmed in the streets of the little town.
      The truth was, that the invalid had insisted that, during his stay, all
      the waiters and stable-boys of the Castle should wear his livery.
    </p>
    <p>
      His colleagues were in despair. The Duke of Grafton proposed to go down to
      Marlborough in order to consult the oracle. But he was informed that Lord
      Chatham must decline all conversation on business.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <span class="pagenum">97</span><a name="link97" id="link97"></a>the
      mean time, all the parties which were out of office, Bedfords, Grenvilles,
      and Rockinghams, joined to oppose the distracted government on the vote
      for the land tax. They were reinforced by almost all the county members,
      and had a considerable majority. This was the first time that a ministry
      had been beaten on an important division in the House of Commons since the
      fall of Sir Robert Walpole. The administration, thus furiously assailed
      from without, was torn by internal dissensions. It had been formed on no
      principle whatever. From the very first, nothing but Chatham&rsquo;s authority
      had prevented the hostile contingents which made up his ranks from going
      to blows with each other. That authority was now withdrawn, and every
      thing was in commotion. Conway, a brave soldier, but in civil affairs the
      most timid and irresolute of men, afraid of disobliging the King, afraid
      of being abused in the newspapers, afraid of being thought factious if he
      went out, afraid of being thought interested if he stayed in, afraid of
      every thing, and afraid of being known to be afraid of any thing, was
      beaten backwards and forwards like a shuttlecock between Horace Walpole
      who wished to make him prime minister, and Lord John Cavendish who wished
      to draw him into opposition. Charles Townshend, a man of splendid
      eloquence, of lax principles, and of boundless vanity and presumption,
      would submit to no control. The full extent of his parts, of his ambition,
      and of his arrogance, had not yet been made manifest; for he had always
      quailed before the genius and the lofty character of Pitt. But now that
      Pitt had quitted the House of Commons, and seemed to have abdicated the
      part of chief minister, Townshend broke loose from all restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      While <span class="pagenum">98</span><a name="link98" id="link98"></a>things
      were in this state, Chatnam at length returned to London. He might as well
      have remained at Marlborough. He would see nobody. He would give no
      opinion on any public matter. The Duke of Grafton begged piteously for an
      interview, for an hour, for half an hour, for five minutes. The answer
      was, that it was impossible. The King himself repeatedly condescended to
      expostulate and implore. &ldquo;Your duty,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;your own honour, require
      you to make an effort.&rdquo; The answers to these appeals were commonly written
      in Lady Chatham&rsquo;s hand, from her lord&rsquo;s dictation; for he had not energy
      even to use a pen. He flings himself at the King&rsquo;s feet. He is penetrated
      by the royal goodness so signally shown to the most unhappy of men. He
      implores a little more indulgence. He cannot as yet transact business. He
      cannot see his colleagues. Least of all can he bear the excitement of an
      interview with majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some were half inclined to suspect that he was, to use a military phrase,
      malingering. He had made, they said, a great blunder, and had found it
      out. His immense popularity, his high reputation for statesmanship, were
      gone for ever. Intoxicated by pride, he had undertaken a task beyond his
      abilities. He now saw nothing before him but distresses and humiliations;
      and he had therefore simulated illness, in order to escape from vexations
      which he had not fortitude to meet. This suspicion, though it derived some
      colour from that weakness which was the most striking blemish of his
      character, was certainly unfounded. His mind, before he became first
      minister, had been, as we have said, in an unsound state; and physical and
      moral causes now concurred to make the derangement of his faculties
      complete. The gout, which had been the torment <span class="pagenum">99</span><a
      name="link99" id="link99"></a>of his whole life, had been suppressed by
      strong remedies. For the first time since he was a boy at Oxford, he had
      passed several months without a twinge. But his hand and foot had been
      relieved at the expense of his nerves. He became melancholy, fanciful,
      irritable. The embarrassing state of public affairs, the grave
      responsibility which lay on him, the consciousness of his errors, the
      disputes of his colleagues, the savage clamours raised by his detractors,
      bewildered his enfeebled mind. One thing alone, he said, could save him.
      He must repurchase Hayes. The unwilling consent of the new occupant was
      extorted by Lady Chatham&rsquo;s entreaties and tears; and her lord was somewhat
      easier. But if business were mentioned to him, he, once the proudest and
      boldest of mankind, behaved like a hysterical girl, trembled from head to
      foot, and burst into a flood of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      His colleagues for a time continued to entertain the expectation that his
      health would soon be restored, and that he would emerge from his
      retirement. But month followed month, and still he remained hidden in
      mysterious seclusion, and sunk, as far as they could learn, in the deepest
      dejection of spirits. They at length ceased to hope or to fear any thing
      from him; and though he was still nominally Prime Minister, took without
      scruple steps which they knew to be diametrically opposed to all his
      opinions and feelings, allied themselves with those whom he had
      proscribed, disgraced those whom he most esteemed, and laid taxes on the
      colonies, in the face of the strong declarations which he had recently
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had passed about a year and three quarters in gloomy privacy, the
      King received a few lines in Lady Chatham&rsquo;s hand. They contained a
      request, dictated <span class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100"
       id="link100"></a>by her lord, that he might be permitted to resign the
      Privy Seal. After some civil show of reluctance, the resignation was
      accepted. Indeed Chatham was, by this time, almost as much forgotten as if
      he had already been lying in Westminster Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the clouds which had gathered over his mind broke and passed
      away, his gout returned, and freed him from a more cruel malady. His
      nerves were newly braced. His spirits became buoyant. He woke as from a
      sickly dream. It was a strange recovery. Men had been in the habit of
      talking of him as of one dead, and, when he first showed himself at the
      King&rsquo;s levee, started as if they had seen a ghost. It was more than two
      years and a half since he had appeared in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, had cause for wonder. The world which he now entered was not the
      world which he had quitted. The administration which he had formed had
      never been, at any one moment, entirely changed. But there had been so
      many losses and so many accessions, that he could scarcely recognise his
      own work. Charles Townshend was dead. Lord Shelburne had been dismissed.
      Conway had sunk into utter insignificance. The Duke of Grafton had fallen
      into the hands of the Bedfords. The Bedfords had deserted Grenville, had
      made their peace with the King and the King&rsquo;s friends, and had been
      admitted to office. Lord North was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was
      rising fast in importance. Corsica had been given up to France without a
      struggle. The disputes with the American colonies had been revived. A
      general election had taken place. Wilkes had returned from exile, and,
      outlaw as he was, had been chosen knight of the shire for Middlesex. The
      multitude was on his side. <span class="pagenum">101</span><a
      name="link101" id="link101"></a>The Court was obstinately bent on ruining
      him, and was prepared to shake the very foundations of the constitution
      for the sake of a paltry revenge. The House of Commons, assuming to itself
      an authority which of right belongs only to the whole legislature, had
      declared Wilkes incapable of sitting in Parliament. Nor had it been
      thought sufficient to keep him out. Another must be brought in. Since the
      freeholders of Middlesex had obstinately refused to choose a member
      acceptable to the Court, the House had chosen a member for them. This was
      not the only instance, perhaps not the most disgraceful instance, of the
      inveterate malignity of the Court. Exasperated by the steady opposition of
      the Rockingham party, the King&rsquo;s friends had tried to rob a distinguished
      Whig nobleman of his private estate, and had persisted in their mean
      wickedness till their own servile majority had revolted from mere disgust
      and shame. Discontent had spread throughout the nation, and was kept up by
      stimulants such as had rarely been applied to the public mind. Junius had
      taken the field, had trampled Sir William Draper in the dust, had well
      nigh broken the heart of Blackstone, and had so mangled the reputation of
      the Duke of Grafton, that his grace had become sick of office, and was
      beginning to look wistfully towards the shades of Euston. Every principle
      of foreign, domestic, and colonial policy which was dear to the heart of
      Chatham, had, during the eclipse of his genius, been violated by the
      government which he had formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining years of his life were spent in vainly struggling against
      that fatal policy which, at the moment when he might have given it a death
      blow, he had been induced to take under his protection. His exertions
      <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>redeemed
      his own fame, but they effected little for his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found two parties arrayed against the government, the party of his own
      brothers-in-law, the Grenvilles, and the party of Lord Rockingham. On the
      question of the Middlesex election these parties were agreed. But on many
      other important questions they differed widely; and they were, in truth,
      not less hostile to each other than to the Court. The Grenvilles had,
      during several years, annoyed the Rockinghams with a succession of
      acrimonious pamphlets. It was long before the Rockinghams could be induced
      to retaliate. But an ill natured tract, written under Grenville&rsquo;s
      direction, and entitled a State of the Nation, was too much for their
      patience. Burke undertook to defend and avenge his friends, and executed
      the task with admirable skill and vigour. On every point he was
      victorious, and nowhere more completely victorious than when he joined
      issue on those dry and minute questions of statistical and financial
      detail in which the main strength of Grenville lay. The official drudge,
      even on his own chosen ground, was utterly unable to maintain the fight
      against the great orator and philosopher. When Chatham reappeared,
      Grenville was still writhing with the recent shame and smart of this well
      merited chastisement. Cordial cooperation between the two sections of the
      Opposition was impossible. Nor could Chatham easily connect himself with
      either. His feelings, in spite of many affronts given and received, drew
      him towards the Grenvilles. For he had strong domestic affections; and his
      nature, which, though haughty, was by no means obdurate, had been softened
      by affliction. But from his kinsmen he was separated by a wide difference
      <span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>of
      opinion on the question of colonial taxation. A reconciliation, however,
      took place. He visited Stowe: he shook hands with George Grenville; and
      the Whig freeholders of Buckinghamshire, at their public dinners, drank
      many bumpers to the union of the three brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In opinions, Chatham was much nearer to the Rockinghams than to his own
      relatives. But between him and the Rockinghams there was a gulf not easily
      to be passed. He had deeply injured them, and in injuring them, had deeply
      injured his country. When the balance was trembling between them and the
      Court, he had thrown the whole weight of his genius, of his renown, of his
      popularity, into the scale of misgovernment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be added, that many eminent members of the party still retained a
      bitter recollection of the asperity and disdain with which they had been
      treated by him at the time when he assumed the direction of affairs. It is
      clear from Burke&rsquo;s pamphlets and speeches, and still more clear from his
      private letters, and from the language which he held in conversation, that
      he regarded Chatham with a feeling not far removed from dislike. Chatham
      was undoubtedly conscious of his error, and desirous to atone for it. But
      his overtures of friendship, though made with earnestness, and even with
      unwonted humility, were at first received by Lord Rockingham with cold and
      austere reserve. Gradually the intercourse of the two statesmen became
      courteous and even amicable. But the past was never wholly forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatham did not, however, stand alone. Round him gathered a party, small
      in number, but strong in great and various talents. Lord Camden, Lord
      Shelburne, Colonel Barré, and Dunning, afterwards Lord Ashburton, <span
      class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>were the
      principal members of this connection. There is no reason to believe that,
      from this time till within a few weeks of Chatham&rsquo;s death, his intellect
      suffered any decay. His eloquence was almost to the last heard with
      delight. But it was not exactly the eloquence of the House of Lords. That
      lofty and passionate, but somewhat desultory declamation, in which he
      excelled all men, and which was set off by looks, tones, and gestures,
      worthy of Garrick or Talma, was out of place in a small apartment where
      the audience often consisted of three or four drowsy prelates, three or
      four old judges, accustomed during many years to disregard rhetorick, and
      to look only at facts and arguments, and three or four listless and
      supercilious men of fashion, whom any thing like enthusiasm moved to a
      sneer. In the House of Commons, a flash of his eye, a wave of his arm, had
      sometimes cowed Murray. But, in the House of Peers, his utmost vehemence
      and pathos produced less effect than the moderation, the reasonableness,
      the luminous order and the serene dignity, which characterized the
      speeches of Lord Mansfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the question of the Middlesex election, all the three divisions of the
      Opposition acted in concert. No orator in either House defended what is
      now universally admitted to have been the constitutional cause with more
      ardour or eloquence than Chatham. Before this subject had ceased to occupy
      the public mind, George Grenville died. His party rapidly melted away; and
      in a short time most of his adherents appeared on the ministerial benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had George Grenville lived many months longer, the friendly ties which,
      after years of estrangement and <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>hostility, had been renewed between him
      and his brother-in-law, would, in all probability, have been a second time
      violently dissolved. For now the quarrel between England and the North
      American colonies took a gloomy and terrible aspect. Oppression provoked
      resistance; resistance was made the pretext for fresh oppression. The
      warnings of all the greatest statesmen of the age were lost on an
      imperious court and a deluded nation. Soon a colonial senate confronted
      the British Parliament. Then the colonial militia crossed bayonets with
      the British regiments. At length the commonwealth was torn asunder. Two
      millions of Englishmen, who, fifteen years before, had been as loyal to
      their prince and as proud of their country as the people of Kent or
      Yorkshire, separated themselves by a solemn act from the Empire. For a
      time it seemed that the insurgents would struggle to small purpose against
      the vast financial and military means of the mother country. But
      disasters, following one another in rapid succession, rapidly dispelled
      the illusions of national vanity. At length a great British force,
      exhausted, famished, harassed on every side by a hostile peasantry, was
      compelled to deliver up its arms. Those governments which England had, in
      the late war, so signally humbled, and which had during many years been
      sullenly brooding over the recollections of Quebec, of Minden, and of the
      Moro, now saw with exultation that the day of revenge was at hand. France
      recognised the independence of the United States; and there could be
      little doubt that the example would soon be followed by Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatham and Rockingham had cordially concurred in opposing every part of
      the fatal policy which had brought the state into this dangerous
      situation. But their <span class="pagenum">106</span><a name="link106"
       id="link106"></a>paths now diverged. Lord Rockingham thought, and, as the
      event proved, thought most justly, that the revolted colonies were
      separated from the Empire for ever, and that the only effect of prolonging
      the war on the American continent would be to divide resources which it
      was desirable to concentrate. If the hopeless attempt to subjugate
      Pennsylvania and Virginia were abandoned, war against the House of Bourbon
      might possibly be avoided, or, if inevitable, might be carried on with
      success and glory. We might even indemnify ourselves for part of what we
      had lost, at the expense of those foreign enemies who had hoped to profit
      by our domestic dissensions. Lord Rockingham, therefore, and those who
      acted with him, conceived that the wisest course now open to England was
      to acknowledge the independence of the United States, and to turn her
      whole force against her European enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatham, it should seem, ought to have taken the same side. Before France
      had taken any part in our quarrel with the colonies, he had repeatedly,
      and with great energy of language, declared that it was impossible to
      conquer America, and he could not without absurdity maintain that it was
      easier to conquer France and America together than America alone. But his
      passions overpowered his judgment, and made him blind to his own
      inconsistency. The very circumstances which made the separation of the
      colonies inevitable made it to him altogether insupportable. The
      dismemberment of the Empire seemed to him less ruinous and humiliating,
      when produced by domestic dissensions, than when produced by foreign
      interference. His blood boiled at the degradation of his country. Whatever
      lowered her among the nations of <span class="pagenum">107</span><a
      name="link107" id="link107"></a>the earth, he felt as a personal outrage
      to himself. And the feeling was natural. He had made her so great. He had
      been so proud of her; and she had been so proud of him. He remembered how,
      more than twenty years before, in a day of gloom and dismay, when her
      possessions were torn from her, when her flag was dishonoured, she had
      called on him to save her. He remembered the sudden and glorious change
      which his energy had wrought, the long series of triumphs, the days of
      thanksgiving, the nights of illumination. Fired by such recollections, he
      determined to separate himself from those who advised that the
      independence of the colonies should be acknowledged. That he was in error
      will scarcely, we think, be disputed by his warmest admirers. Indeed, the
      treaty, by which, a few years later, the republic of the United States was
      recognised, was the work of his most attached adherents and of his
      favourite son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Richmond had given notice of an address to the throne, against
      the further prosecution of hostilities with America. Chatham had, during
      some time, absented himself from Parliament, in consequence of his growing
      infirmities. He determined to appear in his place on this occasion, and to
      declare that his opinions were decidedly at variance with those of the
      Rockingham party. He was in a state of great excitement. His medical
      attendants were uneasy, and strongly advised him to calm himself, and to
      remain at home. But he was not to be controlled. His son William, and his
      son-in-law Lord Mahon, accompanied him to Westminster. He rested himself
      in the Chancellor&rsquo;s room till the debate commenced, and then, leaning on
      his two young relations, limped to his seat. The slightest particulars of
      that day <span class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108" id="link108"></a>were
      remembered, and have been carefully recorded. He bowed, it was remarked,
      with great courtliness to those peers who rose to make way for him and his
      supporters. His crutch was in his hand, he wore, as was his fashion, a
      rich velvet coat. His legs were swathed in flannel. His wig was so large,
      and his face so emaciated, that none of his features could be discerned,
      except the high curve of his nose, and his eyes, which still retained a
      gleam of the old fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Duke of Richmond had spoken, Chatham rose. For some time his
      voice was inaudible. At length his tones became distinct and his action
      animated. Here and there his hearers caught a thought or an expression
      which reminded them of William Pitt. But it was clear that he was not
      himself. He lost the thread of his discourse, hesitated, repeated the same
      words several times, and was so confused that, in speaking of the Act of
      Settlement, he could not recall the name of the Electress Sophia. The
      House listened in solemn silence, and with the aspect of profound respect
      and compassion. The stillness was so deep that the dropping of a
      handkerchief would have been heard. The Duke of Richmond replied with
      great tenderness and courtesy; but while he spoke, the old man was
      observed to be restless and irritable. The Duke sat down. Chatham stood up
      again, pressed his hand on his breast, and sank down in an apoplectic fit.
      Three or four lords who sat near him caught him in his fall. The House
      broke up in confusion. The dying man was carried to the residence of one
      of the officers of Parliament, and was so far restored as to be able to
      bear a journey to Hayes. At Hayes, after lingering a few weeks, he expired
      in his <span class="pagenum">109</span><a name="link109" id="link109"></a>seventieth
      year. His bed was watched to the last, with anxious tenderness, by his
      wife and children; and he well deserved their care. Too often haughty and
      wayward to others, to them he had been almost effeminately kind. He had
      through life been dreaded by his political opponents, and regarded with
      more awe than love even by his political associates. But no fear seems to
      have mingled with the affection which his fondness, constantly overflowing
      in a thousand endearing forms, had inspired in the little circle at Hayes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatham, at the time of his decease, had not, in both Houses of
      Parliament, ten personal adherents. Half the public men of the age had
      been estranged from him by his errors, and the other half by the exertions
      which he had made to repair his errors. His last speech had been an attack
      at once on the policy pursued by the government, and on the policy
      recommended by the opposition. But death restored him to his old place in
      the affection of his country. Who could hear unmoved of the fall of that
      which had been so great, and which had stood so long? The circumstances,
      too, seemed rather to belong to the tragic stage than to real life. A
      great statesman, full of years and honours, led forth to the Senate House
      by a son of rare hopes, and stricken down in full council while straining
      his feeble voice to rouse the drooping spirit of his country, could not
      but be remembered with peculiar veneration and tenderness. The few
      detractors who ventured to murmur were silenced by the indignant clamours
      of a nation which remembered only the lofty genius, the unsullied probity,
      the undisputed services, of him who was no more. For once, the chiefs of
      all parties were agreed. A public funeral, a <span class="pagenum">110</span><a
      name="link110" id="link110"></a>public monument, were eagerly voted. The
      debts of the deceased were paid. A provision was made for his family. The
      City of London requested that the remains of the great man whom she had so
      long loved and honoured might rest under the dome of her magnificent
      cathedral. But the petition came too late. Every thing was already
      prepared for the interment in Westminster Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though men of all parties had concurred in decreeing posthumous honours to
      Chatham, his corpse was attended to the grave almost exclusively by
      opponents of the government. The banner of the lordship of Chatham was
      borne by Colonel Barré, attended by the Duke of Richmond and Lord
      Rockingham. Burke, Savile, and Dunning upheld the pall. Lord Camden was
      conspicuous in the procession. The chief mourner was young William Pitt.
      After the lapse of more than twenty-seven years, in a season as dark and
      perilous, his own shattered frame and broken heart were laid, with the
      same pomp, in the same consecrated mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatham sleeps near the northern door of the Church, in a spot which has
      ever since been appropriated to statesmen, as the other end of the same
      transept has long been to poets. Mansfield rests there, and the second
      William Pitt, and Fox, and Grattan, and Canning, and Wilberforce. In no
      other cemetery do so many great citizens he within so narrow a space. High
      over those venerable graves towers the stately monument of Chatham, and
      from above, his effigy, graven by a cunning hand, seems still, with eagle
      face and outstretched arm, to bid England be of good cheer, and to hurl
      defiance at her foes. The generation which reared that memorial of him has
      disappeared. The time has come when the rash and indiscriminate judgments
      <span class="pagenum">111</span><a name="link111" id="link111"></a>which
      his contemporaries passed on his character may be calmly revised by
      history. And history, while, for the warning of vehement, high, and daring
      natures, she notes his many errors, will yet deliberately pronounce, that,
      among the eminent men whose bones he near his, scarcely one has left a
      more stainless, and none a more splendid name.

    <h2>
      FRANCIS ATTERBURY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Encyclopodia Britannica</i>, December 1853.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rancis Atterbury,
      <span class="pagenum">112</span><a name="link112" id="link112"></a>a man
      who holds a conspicuous place in the political, ecclesiastical, and
      literary history of England, was born in the year 1662, at Middleton in
      Buckinghamshire, a parish of which his father was rector. Francis was
      educated at Westminster School, and carried thence to Christ Church a
      stock of learning which, though really scanty, he through life exhibited
      with such judicious ostentation that superficial observers believed his
      attainments to be immense. At Oxford, his parts, his taste, and his bold,
      contemptuous, and imperious spirit, soon made him conspicuous. Here he
      published, at twenty, his first work, a translation of the noble poem of
      Absalom and Achitophel into Latin verse. Neither the style nor the
      versification of the young scholar was that of the Augustan age. In
      English composition he succeeded much better. In 1687 he distinguished
      himself among many able men who wrote in defence of the Church of England,
      then persecuted by James II., and calumniated by apostates who had for
      lucre quitted her communion. Among these apostates none was more active or
      malignant than Obadiah Walker, who was master of University College, and
      who had set up there, under the royal patronage, a press for printing
      tracts <span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a>against
      the established religion. In one of these tracts, written apparently by
      Walker himself, many aspersions were thrown on Martin Luther. Atterbury
      undertook to defend the great Saxon Reformer, and performed that task in a
      manner singularly characteristic. Whoever examines his reply to Walker
      will be struck by the contrast between the feebleness of those parts which
      are argumentative and defensive, and the vigour of those parts which are
      rhetorical and aggressive. The Papists were so much galled by the sarcasms
      and invectives of the young polemic that they raised a cry of treason, and
      accused him of having, by implication, called King James a Judas.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Revolution, Atterbury, though bred in the doctrines of
      non-resistance and passive obedience, readily swore fealty to the new
      government. In no long time he took holy orders. He occasionally preached
      in London with an eloquence which raised his reputation, and soon had the
      honour of being appointed one of the royal chaplains. But he ordinarily
      resided at Oxford, where he took an active part in academical business,
      directed the classical studies of the undergraduates of his college, and
      was the chief adviser and assistant of Dean Aldrich, a divine now chiefly
      remembered by his catches, but renowned among his contemporaries as a
      scholar, a Tory, and a high-churchman. It was the practice, not a very
      judicious practice, of Aldrich to employ the most promising youths of his
      college in editing Greek and Latin books. Among the studious and
      well-disposed lads who were, unfortunately for themselves, induced to
      become teachers of philology when they should have been content to be
      learners, was Charles Boyle, son of the Earl of Orrery, and nephew of
      Robert Boyle, the great experimental <span class="pagenum">114</span><a
      name="link114" id="link114"></a>philosopher. The task assigned to Charles
      Boyle was to prepare a new edition of one of the most worthless books in
      existence. It was a fashion, amoung those Greeks and Romans who cultivated
      rhetoric as an art, to compose epistles and harangues in the names of
      eminent men. Some of these counterfeits are fabricated with such exquisite
      taste and skill that it is the highest achievement of criticism to
      distinguish them from originals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others are so feebly and rudely executed that they can hardly impose on an
      intelligent school-boy. The best specimen which has come down to us is
      perhaps the oration for Marcellus, such an imitation of Tully&rsquo;s eloquence
      as Tally would himself have read with wonder and delight. The worst
      specimen is perhaps a collection of letters purporting to have been
      written by that Phalaris who governed Agrigentum more than 500 years
      before the Christian era. The evidence, both internal and external,
      against the genuineness of these letters is overwhelming. When, in the
      fifteenth century, they emerged, in company with much that was far more
      valuable, from their obscurity, they were pronounced spurious by Politian,
      the greatest scholar of Italy, and by Erasmus, the greatest scholar on our
      side of the Alps. In truth, it would be as easy to persuade an educated
      Englishman that one of Johnson&rsquo;s Ramblers was the work of William Wallace
      as to persuade a man like Erasmus that a pedantic exercise, composed in
      the trim and artificial Attic of the time of Julian, was a despatch
      written by a crafty and ferocious Dorian, who roasted people alive many
      years before there existed a volume of prose in the Greek language. But,
      though Christ-Church could boast of many good Latinists, of many good
      English writers, and of a greater number of clever and fashionable <span
      class="pagenum">115</span><a name="link115" id="link115"></a>men of the
      world than belonged to any other academic body, there was not then in the
      college a single man capable of distinguishing between the infancy and the
      dotage of Greek literature. So superficial indeed was the learning; of the
      rulers of this celebrated society that they were charmed by an essay which
      Sir William Temple published in praise of the ancient writers. It now
      seems strange that even the eminent public services, the deserved
      popularity, and the graceful style of Temple should have saved so silly a
      performance from universal contempt. Of the books which he most vehemently
      eulogised his eulogies proved that he knew nothing. In fact, he could not
      read a line of the language in which they were written. Among many other
      foolish things, he said that the letters of Phalaris were the oldest
      letters and also the best in the world. Whatever Temple wrote attracted
      notice. People who had never heard of the Epistles of Phalaris began to
      inquire about them. Aldrich, who knew very little Greek, took the word of
      Temple who knew none, and desired Boyle to prepare a new edition of these
      admirable compositions which, having long slept in obscurity, had become
      on a sudden objects of general interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The edition was prepared with the help of Atterbury, who was Boyle&rsquo;s
      tutor, and of some other members of the college. It was an edition such as
      might be expected from people who would stoop to édité such a book. The
      notes were worthy of the text; the Latin version worthy of the Greek
      original. The volume would have been forgotten in a month, had not a
      misunderstanding about a manuscript arisen between the young editor and
      the greatest scholar that had appeared in Europe since the revival of
      letters, Richard Bentley. <span class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116"
       id="link116"></a>The manuscript was in Bentley&rsquo;s keeping. Boyle wished it
      to be collated. A mischief-making bookseller informed him that Bentley had
      refused to lend it, which was false and also that Bentley had spoken
      contemptuously of the letters attributed to Phalaris, and of the critics
      who were taken in by such counterfeits, which was perfectly true. Boyle,
      much provoked, paid, in his preface, a bitterly ironical compliment to
      Bentley&rsquo;s courtesy. Bentley revenged himself by a short dissertation, in
      which he proved that the epistles were spurious, and the new edition of
      them worthless: but he treated Boyle personally with civility as a young
      gentleman of great hopes, whose love of learning was highly commendable,
      and who deserved to have had better instructors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few things in literary history are more extraordinary than the storm which
      this little dissertation raised. Bentley had treated Boyle with
      forbearance; but he had treated Christ-Church with contempt; and the
      Christ-Church-men, wherever dispersed, were as much attached to their
      college as a Scotchman to his country, or a Jesuit to his order. Their
      influence was great. They were dominant at Oxford, powerful in the Inns of
      Court and in the College of Physicians, conspicuous in Parliament and in
      the literary and fashionable circles of London. Their unanimous cry was,
      that the honour of the college must be vindicated, that the insolent
      Cambridge pedant must be put down. Poor Boyle was unequal to the task, and
      disinclined to it. It was, therefore, assigned to his tutor Atterbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer to Bentley, which bears the name of Boyle, but which was, in
      truth, no more the work of Boyle than the letters to which the controversy
      related were the work of Phalaris, is now read only by the curious, <span
      class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117" id="link117"></a>and will in
      all probability never be reprinted again. But it had its day of noisy
      popularity. It was to be found, not only in the studies of men of letters,
      but on the tables of the most brilliant drawing-rooms of Soho Square and
      Covent Garden. Even the beaus and coquettes of that age, the Wildairs and
      the Lady Lurewells, the Mirabells and the Millamants, congratulated each
      other on the way in which the gay young gentleman, whose erudition sate so
      easily upon him, and who wrote with so much pleasantry and good breeding
      about the Attic dialect and the anapæstic measure, Sicilian talents and
      Therielean cups, had bantered the queer prig of a doctor. Nor was the
      applause of the multitude undeserved. The book is, indeed, Atterbury&rsquo;s
      masterpiece, and gives a higher notion of his powers than any of those
      works to which he put his name. That he was altogether in the wrong on the
      main question, and on all the collateral questions springing out of it,
      that his knowledge of the language, the literature, and the history of
      Greece was not equal to what many freshmen now bring up every year to
      Cambridge and Oxford, and that some of his blunders seem rather to deserve
      a flogging than a refutation, is true; and therefore it is that his
      performance is, in the highest degree, interesting and valuable to a
      judicious reader. It is good by reason of its exceeding badness. It is the
      most extraordinary instance that exists of the art of making much show
      with little substance. There is no difficulty, says the steward of
      Molière&rsquo;s miser, in giving a fine dinner with plenty of money: the really
      great cook is he who can set out a banquet with no money at all. That
      Bentley should have written excellently on ancient chronology and
      geography, on the development of the Greek language, and the origin of the
      <span class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118" id="link118"></a>Greek
      drama, is not strange. But that Atterbury should, during some years, have
      been thought to have treated these subjects much better than Bentley is
      strange indeed. It is true that the champion of Christ-Church had all the
      help which the most celebrated members of that society could give him.
      Smalridge contributed some very good wit; Friend and others some very bad
      archaeology and philology. But the greater part of the volume was entirely
      Atterbury&rsquo;s: what was not his own was revised and retouched by him; and
      the whole bears the mark of his mind, a mind inexhaustibly rich in all the
      resources of controversy, and familiar with all the artifices which make
      falsehood look like truth, and ignorance like knowledge. He had little
      gold; but he beat that little out to the very thinnest leaf, and spread it
      over so vast a surface that to those who judged by a glance, and who did
      not resort to balances and tests, the glittering heap of worthless matter
      which he produced seemed to be an inestimable treasure of massy bullion.
      Such arguments as he had he placed in the clearest light. Where he had no
      arguments, he resorted to personalities, sometimes serious, generally
      ludicrous, always clever and cutting. But, whether he was grave or merry,
      whether he reasoned or sneered, his style was always pure, polished, and
      easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Party spirit then ran high; yet, though Bentley ranked among Whigs, and
      Christ-Church was a stronghold of Toryism, Whigs joined with Tories in
      applauding Atterbury&rsquo;s volume. Garth insulted Bentley, and extolled Boyle
      in lines which are now never quoted except to be laughed at. Swift, in his
      &ldquo;Battle of the Books,&rdquo; introduced with much pleasantry Boyle, clad in
      armour, the gift of all the gods, and directed by Apollo <span
      class="pagenum">110</span><a name="link110" id="link110_"></a>in the form
      of a human friend, for whose name a blank is left which may easily be
      filled up. The youth, so accoutred, and so assisted, gains an easy victory
      over his uncourteous and boastful antagonist Bentley, meanwhile, was
      supported by the consciousness of an immeasurable superiority, and
      encouraged by the voices of the few who were really competent to judge the
      combat. &ldquo;No man,&rdquo; he said, justly and nobly, &ldquo;was ever written down but by
      himself.&rdquo; He spent two years in preparing a reply, which will never cease
      to be read and prized while the literature of ancient Greece is studied in
      any part of the world. This reply proved, not only that the letters
      ascribed to Phalaris were spurious, but that Atterbury, with all his wit,
      his eloquence, his skill in controversial fence, was the most audacious
      pretender that ever wrote about what he did not understand. But to
      Atterbury this exposure was matter of indifference. He was now engaged in
      a dispute about matters far more important and exciting than the laws of
      Zaleucus and the law&rsquo;s of Charondas. The rage of religions factions was
      extreme. High church and Low church divided the nation. The great majority
      of the clergy were on the high-church side; the majority of King William&rsquo;s
      bishops were inclined to latitudinarianism.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dispute arose between the two parties touching the extent of the powers
      of the Lower House of Convocation. Atterbury thrust himself eagerly into
      the front rank of the high-churchmen. Those who take a comprehensive and
      impartial view of his whole career will not be disposed to give him credit
      for religious zeal. But it was his nature to be vehement and pugnacious in
      the cause of every fraternity of which he was a member. He had defended
      the genuineness of <span class="pagenum">120</span><a name="link120"
       id="link120"></a>a spurious book simply because Christ-Church had put
      forth an edition of that book; he now stood up for the clergy against the
      civil power, simply because he was a clergyman, and for the priests
      against the episcopal order, simply because he was as yet only a priest,
      he asserted the pretensions of the class to which he belonged in several
      treatises written with much wit, ingenuity, audacity, and acrimony. In
      this, as in his first controversy, he was opposed to antagonists whose
      knowledge of the subject in dispute was far superior to his; but in this,
      as in his first controversy, he imposed on the multitude by bold
      assertion, by sarcasm, by declamation, and, above all, by his peculiar
      knack of exhibiting a little erudition in such a manner as to make it look
      like a great deal. Having passed himself off on the world as a greater
      master of classical learning than Bentley, he now passed himself off as a
      greater master of ecclesiastical learning than Wake or Gibson. By the
      great body of the clergy he was regarded as the ablest and most intrepid
      tribune that had ever defended their rights against the oligarchy of
      prelates. The Lower House of Convocation voted him thanks for his
      services; the University of Oxford created him a doctor of divinity; and
      soon after the accession of Anne, while the Tories still had the chief
      weight in the government, he was promoted to the deanery of Carlisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after he had obtained this preferment, the Whig party rose to
      ascendency in the state. From that party he could expect no favour. Six
      years elapsed before a change of fortune took place. At length, in the
      year 1710, the prosecution of Sacheverell produced a formidable explosion
      of high-church fanaticism. At such a moment Atterbury could not fail to
      <span class="pagenum">121</span><a name="link121" id="link121"></a>be
      conspicuous. His inordinate zeal for the body to which he belonged, his
      turbulent and aspiring temper, his rare talents for agitation and for
      controversy, were again signally displayed. He bore a chief part in
      framing that artful and eloquent speech which the accused divine
      pronounced at the bar of the Lords, and which presents a singular contrast
      to the absurd and scurrilous sermon which had very unwisely been honoured
      with impeachment. During the troubled and anxious months which followed
      the trial, Atterbury was among the most active of those pamphleteers who
      inflamed the nation against the Whig ministry and the Whig parliament.
      When the ministry had been changed and the parliament dissolved, rewards
      were showered upon him. The Lower House of Convocation elected him
      prolocutor. The Queen appointed him Dean of Christ-Church on the death of
      his old friend and patron Aldrich. The college would have preferred a
      gentler ruler. Nevertheless, the new head was received with every mark of
      honour. A congratulatory oration in Latin was addressed to him in the
      magnificent vestibule of the hall; and he in reply professed the warmest
      attachment to the venerable house in which he had been educated, and paid
      many gracious compliments to those over whom he was to preside. But it was
      not in his nature to be a mild or an equitable governor. He had left the
      chapter of Carlisle distracted by quarrels. He found Christ-Church at
      peace; but in three months his despotic and contentious temper did at
      Christ-Church what it had done at Carlisle. He was succeeded in both his
      deaneries by the humane and accomplished Smalridge, who gently complained
      of the state in which both had been left. Atterbury goes before, and sets
      everything on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">122</span><a name="link122" id="link122"></a>come
      after him with a bucket of water.&rdquo; It was said by Atterbury&rsquo;s enemies that
      he was made a bishop because he was so bad a dean. Under his
      administration Christ-Church was in confusion; scandalous altercations
      took place, opprobrious words were exchanged; and there was reason to fear
      that the great Tory college would be ruined by the tyranny of the great
      Tory doctor. He was soon removed to the bishopric of Rochester, which was
      then always united with the deanery of Westminster. Still higher dignities
      seemed to be before him. For, though there were many able men on the
      episcopal bench, there was none who equalled or approached him in
      parliamentary talents. Had his party continued in power, it is not
      improbable that he would have been raised to the archbishopric of
      Canterbury. The more splendid his prospects, the more reason he had to
      dread the accession of a family which was well known to be partial to the
      Whigs. There is every reason to believe that he was one of those
      politicians who hoped that they might be able, during the life of Anne, to
      prepare matters in such a way that at her decease there might be little
      difficulty in setting aside the Act of Settlement and placing the
      Pretender on the throne. Her sudden death confounded the projects of these
      conspirators. Atterbury, who wanted no kind of courage, implored his
      confederates to proclaim James III., and offered to accompany the heralds
      in lawn sleeves. But he found even the bravest soldiers of his party
      irresolute, and exclaimed, not, it is said, without interjections which
      ill became the mouth of a father of the church, that the best of all
      causes and the most precious of all moments had been pusillanimously
      thrown away. He acquiesced in what he could not prevent, took the oaths to
      the House of <span class="pagenum">123</span><a name="link123" id="link123"></a>Hanover,
      and at the coronation officiated with the outward show of zeal, and did
      his best to ingratiate himself with the royal family. But his servility
      was requited with cold contempt. No creature is so revengeful as a proud
      man who has humbled himself in vain. Atterbury became the most factious
      and pertinacious of all the opponents of the government. In the House of
      Lords his oratory, lucid, pointed, lively, and set off with every grace of
      pronunciation and of gesture, extorted the attention and admiration even
      of a hostile majority. Some of the most remarkable protests which appear
      in the journals of the peers were drawn up by him; and, in some of the
      bitterest of those pamphlets which called on the English to stand up for
      their country against the aliens who had come from beyond the seas to
      oppress and plunder her, critics easily detected his&rsquo; style. When the
      rebellion of 1715 broke out, he refused to sign the paper in which the
      bishops of the province of Canterbury declared their attachment to the
      Protestant succession. He busied himself in electioneering, especially at
      Westminster, where, as dean, he possessed great influence; and was,
      indeed, strongly suspected of having once set on a riotous mob to prevent
      his Whig fellow-citizens from polling.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having been long in indirect communication with the exiled family,
      he, in 1717, began to correspond directly with the Pretender. The first
      letter of the correspondence is extant. In that letter Atterbury boasts of
      having, during many years past, neglected no opportunity of serving the
      Jacobite cause. &ldquo;My daily prayer,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is that you may have success.
      May I live to see that day, and live no longer than I do what is in my
      power to forward it.&rdquo; It is to be remembered that he who wrote thus was a
      man bound to set <span class="pagenum">124</span><a name="link124"
       id="link124"></a>to the church of which he was overseer an example of
      strict probity; that he had repeatedly sworn allegiance to the House of
      Brunswick; that he had assisted in placing the crown on the head of George
      I.; and that he had abjured James III., &ldquo;without equivocation or mental
      reservation, on the true faith of a Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is agreeable to turn from his public to his private life. His turbulent
      spirit, wearied with faction and treason, now and then required repose,
      and found it in domestic endearments, and in the society of the most
      illustrious of the living and of the dead. Of his wife little is known:
      but between him and his daughter there was an affection singularly close
      and tender. The gentleness of his manners when he was in the company of a
      few friends was such as seemed hardly credible to those who knew him only
      by his writings and speeches. The charm of his &ldquo;softer hour&rdquo; has been
      commemorated by one of those friends in imperishable verse. Though
      Atterbury&rsquo;s classical attainments were not great, his taste in English
      literature was excellent; and his admiration of genius was so strong that
      it overpowered even his political and religions antipathies. His fondness
      fur Milton, the mortal enemy of the Stuarts and of the church, was such as
      to many Tories seemed a crime. On the sad night on which Addison was laid
      in the chapel of Henry VII., the Westminster boys remarked that Atterbury
      read the funeral service with a peculiar tenderness and solemnity. The
      favourite companions, however, of the great Tory prelate were, as might
      have been expected, men whose politics had at least a tinge of Toryism. He
      lived on friendly terms with Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. With Prior he had
      a close intimacy, <span class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125"
       id="link125"></a>which some misunderstanding about public affairs at last
      dissolved. Pope found in Atterbury, not only a warm admirer, but a most
      faithful, fearless, and judicious adviser. The poet was a frequent guest
      at the episcopal palace among the elms of Bromley, and entertained not the
      slightest suspicion that his host, now declining in years, confined to an
      easy chair by front, and apparently devoted to literature, was deeply
      concerned in criminal and perilous designs against the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of the Jacobites had been cowed by the events of 1715. It
      revived in 1721. The failure of the South Sea project, the panic in the
      money market, the downfall of great commercial houses, the distress from
      which no part of the kingdom was exempt, had produced general discontent.
      It seemed not improbable that at such a moment an insurrection might be
      successful. An insurrection was planned. The streets, of London were to be
      barricaded; the Tower and the Bank were to be surprised; King George, his
      family, and his chief captains and councillors, were to be arrested; and
      King James was to be proclaimed. The design became known to the Duke of
      Orleans, regent of France, who was on terms of friendship with the House
      of Hanover. He put the English government on its guard. Some of the chief
      malcontents were committed to prison; and among them was Atterbury. No
      bishop of the Church of England had been taken into custody since that
      memorable day when the applauses and prayers of all London had followed
      the seven bishops to the gate of the Tower. The Opposition entertained
      some hope that it might be possible to excite among the people an
      enthusiasm resembling that of their fathers, who rushed into the waters of
      the Thames <span class="pagenum">126</span><a name="link126" id="link126"></a>to
      implore the blessing of Saneroft. Pictures of the heroic confessor in his
      cell were exhibited at the shop windows. Verses in his praise were sung
      about the streets. The restraints by which he was prevented from
      communicating with his accomplices were represented as cruelties worthy of
      the dungeons of the Inquisition. Strong appeals were made to the
      priesthood. Would they tamely permit so gross an insult to be offered to
      their cloth? Would they suffer the ablest, the most eloquent member of
      their profession, the man who had so often stood up for their rights
      against the civil power, to be treated like the vilest of mankind? There
      was considerable excitement; but it was allayed by a temperate and artful
      letter to the clergy, the work, in all probability, of Bishop Gibson, who
      stood high in the favour of Walpole, and shortly after became minister for
      ecclesiastical affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Atterbury remained in close confinement during some months. He had carried
      on his correspondence with the exiled family so cautiously that the
      circumstantial proofs of his guilt, though sufficient to produce entire
      moral conviction, were not sufficient to justify legal conviction. He
      could be reached only by a bill of pains and penalties. Such a bill the
      Whig party, then decidedly predominant in both houses, was quite prepared
      to support. Many hot-headed members of that party were eager to follow the
      precedent which had been set in the case of Sir John Fenwick, and to pass
      an act for cutting off the bishop&rsquo;s head. Cadogan, who commanded the army,
      a brave soldier, but a headstrong politician, is said to have exclaimed
      with great vehemence: &ldquo;Fling him to the lions in the Tower.&rdquo; But the wiser
      and more humane Walpole was always unwilling to shed blood; and his
      influence prevailed. <span class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127"
       id="link127"></a>When parliament met, the evidence against the bishop was
      laid before committees of both houses. Those committees reported that his
      guilt was proved. In the Commons a resolution, pronouncing him a traitor,
      was carried by nearly two to one. A bill was then introduced which
      provided that he should be deprived of his spiritual dignities, that he
      should be banished for life, and that no British subject should hold any
      intercourse with him except by the royal permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bill passed the Commons with little difficulty. For the bishop,
      though invited to defend himself, chose to reserve his defence for the
      assembly of which he was a member. In the Lords the contest was sharp. The
      young Duke of Wharton, distinguished by his parts, his dissoluteness, and
      his versatility, spoke for Atterbury with great effect; and Atterbury&rsquo;s
      own voice was heard for the last time by that unfriendly audience which
      had so often listened to him with mingled aversion and delight. He
      produced few witnesses; nor did those witnesses say much that could be of
      service to him. Among them was Pope. He was called to prove that, while he
      was an inmate of the palace at Bromley, the bishop&rsquo;s time was completely
      occupied by literary and domestic matters, and that no leisure was left
      for plotting. But Pope, who was quite unaccustomed to speak in public,
      lost his head, and, as he afterwards owned, though he had only ten words
      to say, made two or three blunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bill finally passed the Lords by eighty-three votes to forty-three.
      The bishops, with a single exception, were in the majority. Their conduct
      drew on them a sharp taunt from Lord Bathurst, a warm friend of Atterbury
      and a zealous Tory. &ldquo;The wild Indians,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;give no quarter, because
      they believe <span class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128" id="link128"></a>that
      they shall inherit the skill and prowess of every adversary whom they
      destroy. Perhaps the animosity of the right reverend prelates to their
      brother may be explained in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atterbury took leave of those whom he loved with a dignity and tenderness
      worthy of a better man. Three fine lines of his favourite poet were often
      in his mouth: <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"Some natural tears he
      dropped, but wiped them soon: <br /><span class="indent15">The world was
      all before him, where to chuse <br /><span class="indent15">His place of
      rest, and Providence his guide.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting he presented Pope with a Bible, and said, with a
      disingenuousness of which no man who had studied the Bible to much purpose
      would have been guilty: &ldquo;If ever you learn that I have any dealings with
      the Pretender, I give you leave to say that my punishment is just.&rdquo; Pope
      at this time really believed the bishop to be an injured man. Arbuthnot
      seems to have been of the same opinion. Swift, a few months later,
      ridiculed with great bitterness, in the &ldquo;Voyage to Laputa,&rdquo; the evidence
      which had satisfied the two Houses of Parliament. Soon, however, the most
      partial friends of the banished prelate ceased to assert his innocence,
      and contented themselves with lamenting and excusing what they could not
      defend. After a short stay at Brussels, he had taken up his abode at
      Paris, and had become the leading man among the Jacobite refugees who were
      assembled there. He was invited to Rome by the Pretender, who then held
      his mock court under the immediate protection of the Pope. But Atterbury
      felt that a bishop of the Church of England would be strangely out of
      place at the Vatican, and declined the invitation. During some months,
      however, he might flatter himself that he stood high <span class="pagenum">129</span><a
      name="link129" id="link129"></a>in the good graces of James. The
      correspondence between the master and the servant was constant.
      Atterbury&rsquo;s merits were warmly acknowledged; his advice was respectfully
      received; and he was, as Bolingbroke had found before him, the prime
      minister of a king without a kingdom. But the new favourite found, as
      Bolingbroke had found before him, that it was quite as hard to keep the
      shadow of power under a vagrant and mendicant prince as to keep the
      reality of power at Westminster. Though James had neither territories nor
      revenues, neither army nor navy, there was more faction and more intrigue
      among his courtiers than among those of his successful rival. Atterbury
      soon perceived that his counsels were disregarded, if not distrusted. His
      proud spirit was deeply wounded. He quitted Paris, fixed his residence at
      Montpellier, gave up politics, and devoted himself entirely to letters. In
      the sixth year of his exile he had so severe an illness that his daughter,
      herself in very delicate health, determined to run all risks that she
      might see him once more. Having obtained a license from the English
      Government, she went by sea to Bordeaux, but landed there in such a state
      that she could travel only by boat or in a litter. Her father, in spite of
      his infirmities, set out from Montpellier to meet her; and she, with the
      impatience which is often the sign of approaching death, hastened towards
      him. Those who were about her in vain implored her to travel slowly. She
      said that every hour was precious, that she only wished to see her papa
      and to die. She met him at Toulouse, embraced him, received from his hand
      the sacred bread and wine, and thanked God that they had passed one day in
      each other&rsquo;s society before they parted for ever. She died that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <span class="pagenum">130</span><a name="link130" id="link130"></a>was
      some time before even the strong mind of Atterbury recovered from this
      cruel blow. As soon as he was himself again he became eager for action and
      conflict; for grief, which disposes gentle natures to retirement, to
      inaction, and to meditation, only makes restless spirits more restless.
      The Pretender, dull and bigoted as he was, had found out that he had not
      acted wisely in parting with one who, though a heretic, was, in abilities
      and accomplishments, the foremost man of the Jacobite party. The bishop
      was courted back, and was without much difficulty induced to return to
      Paris and to become once more the phantom minister of a phantom monarchy.
      But his long and troubled life was drawing to a close. To the last,
      however, his intellect retained all its keenness and vigour. He learned,
      in the ninth year of his banishment, that he had been accused by Oldmixon,
      as dishonest and malignant a scribbler as any that has been saved from
      oblivion by the Dunciad, of having, in concert with other Christ-Church
      men, garbled Clarendon&rsquo;s History of the Rebellion. The charge, as
      respected Atterbury, had not the slightest foundation: for he was not one
      of the editors of the History, and never saw it till it was printed. He
      published a short vindication of himself, which is a model in its kind,
      luminous, temperate, and dignified. A copy of this little work he sent to
      the Pretender, with a letter singularly eloquent and graceful. It was
      impossible, the old man said, that he should write anything on such a
      subject without being reminded of the resemblance between his own fate and
      that of Clarendon. They were the only two English subjects that had ever
      been banished from their country and debarred from all communication with
      their friends by act of parliament. But here the resemblance ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      One <span class="pagenum">131</span><a name="link131" id="link131"></a>of
      the exiles had been so happy as to bear a chief part in the restoration of
      the Royal house. All that the other could now do was to die asserting the
      rights of that house to the last. A few weeks after this letter was
      written Atterbury died. He had just completed his seventieth year.
    </p>
    <p>
      His body was brought to England, and laid, with great privacy, under the
      nave of Westminster Abbey. Only three mourners followed the coffin. No
      inscription marks the grave. That the epitaph with which Pope honoured the
      memory of his friend does not appear on the walls of the great national
      cemetery is no subject of regret: for nothing worse was ever written by
      Colley Cibber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who wish for more complete information about Atterbury may easily
      collect it from his sermons and his controversial writings, from the
      report of the parliamentary proceedings against him, which will be found
      in the State Trials, from the five volumes of his correspondence, edited
      by Mr. Nichols, and from the first volume of the Stuart papers, edited by
      Mr. Glover. A very indulgent but a very interesting account of the
      bishop&rsquo;s political career will be found in Lord Mahon&rsquo;s valuable History
      of England.

    <h2>
      JOHN BUNYAN.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, May 1854.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ohn Bunyan, <span
      class="pagenum">132</span><a name="link132" id="link132"></a>the most
      popular religious writer in the English language, was born at Elstow,
      about a mile from Bedford, in the year 1628. He may be said to have been
      born a tinker. The tinkers then formed an hereditary caste, which was held
      in no high estimation. They were generally vagrants and pilferers, and
      were often confounded with the gipsies, whom in truth they nearly
      resembled. Bunyan&rsquo;s father was more respectable than most of the tribe. He
      had a fixed residence, and was able to send his son to a village school
      where reading and writing were taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years of John&rsquo;s boyhood were those during which the puritan spirit was
      in the highest vigour all over England; and nowhere had that spirit more
      influence than in Bedfordshire. It is not wonderful, therefore, that a lad
      to whom nature had given a powerful imagination, and sensibility which
      amounted to a disease, should have been early haunted by religious
      terrors. Before he was ten, his sports were interrupted by fits of remorse
      and despair; and his sleep was disturbed by dreams of fiends trying to fly
      away with him. As he grew older, his mental conflicts became still more
      violent. The strong language in which he described them has strangely
      misled all his biographers except <span class="pagenum">133</span><a
      name="link133" id="link133"></a>Mr. Southey. It has long been an ordinary
      practice with pious writers to cite Bunyan as an instance of the
      supernatural power of divine grace to rescue the human soul from the
      lowest depths of wickedness. He is called in one book the most notorious
      of profligates; in another, the brand plucked from the burning. He is
      designated in Mr. Ivimey&rsquo;s History of the Baptists as the depraved Bunyan,
      the wicked tinker of Elstow. Mr. Byland, a man once of great note among
      the Dissenters, breaks out into the following rhapsody:&mdash;&ldquo;No man of
      common sense and common integrity can deny that Bunyan was a practical
      atheist, a worthless contemptible infidel, a vile rebel to God and
      goodness, a common profligate, a soul-despising, a soul-murdering, a
      soul-damning, thoughtless wretch as could exist on the face of the earth.
      Now be astonished, O heavens, to eternity! and wonder, O earth and hell!
      while time endures. Behold this very man become a miracle of mercy, a
      mirror of wisdom, goodness, holiness, truth, and love.&rdquo; But whoever takes
      the trouble to examine the evidence will find that the good men who wrote
      this had been deceived by a phraseology which, as they had been hearing it
      and using it all their lives, they ought to have understood better. There
      cannot be a greater mistake than to infer, from the strong expressions in
      which a devout man bemoans his exceeding sinfulness, that he has led a
      worse life than his neighbours. Many excellent persons, whose moral
      character from boyhood to old age has been free from any stain discernible
      to their fellow creatures, have, in their autobiographies and diaries,
      applied to themselves, and doubtless with sincerity, epithets as severe as
      could be applied to Titus Oates or Mrs. Brownrigg. It is quite certain
      that Bunyan was, at <span class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134"
       id="link134"></a>eighteen, what, in any but the most austerely puritanical
      circles, would have been considered as a young man of singular gravity and
      innocence. Indeed, it may be remarked that he, like many other penitents
      who, in general terms, acknowledge themselves to have been the worst of
      mankind, fired up and stood vigorously on his defence, whenever any
      particular charge was brought against him by others. He declares, it is
      true, that he had let loose the reins on the neck of his lusts, that he
      had delighted in all transgressions against the divine law, and that he
      had been the ringleader of the youth of Elstow in all manner of vice. But,
      when those who wished him ill accused him of licentious amours, he called
      on God and the angels to attest his purity. No woman, he said, in heaven,
      earth, or hell, could charge him with having ever made any improper
      advances to her. Not only had he been strictly faithful to his wife; but
      he had, even before his marriage, been perfectly spotless. It does not
      appear from his own confessions, or from the railings of his enemies, that
      he ever was drunk in his life. One bad habit he contracted, that of using
      profane language; but he tells us that a single reproof cured him so
      effectually that he never offended again. The worst that can be laid to
      the charge of this poor youth, whom it has been the fashion to represent
      as the most desperate of reprobates, as a village Rochester, is that he
      had a great liking for some diversions, quite harmless in themselves, but
      condemned by the rigid precisians among whom he lived, and for whose
      opinion he had a great respect. The four chief sins of which he was guilty
      were dancing, ringing the bells of the parish church, playing at tipcat,
      and reading the History of Sir Bevis of Southampton. A rector of the
      school of Laud would <span class="pagenum">135</span><a name="link135"
       id="link135"></a>have held such a young man up to the whole parish as a
      model. But Bunyan&rsquo;s notions of good and evil had been learned in a very
      different school; and he was made miserable by the conflict between his
      tastes and his scruples.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was about seventeen, the ordinary course of his life was
      interrupted by an event which gave a lasting colour to his thoughts. He
      enlisted in the parliamentary army, and served during the decisive
      campaign of 1645. All that we know of his military career is that, at the
      siege of Leicester, one of his comrades, who had taken his post, was
      killed by a shot from the town. Bnnyan ever after considered himself as
      having been saved from death by the special interference of Providence. It
      may be observed that his imagination was strongly impressed by the glimpse
      which he had caught of the pomp of war. To the last he loved to draw his
      illustrations of sacred things from camps and fortresses, from guns,
      drums, trumpets, flags of truce, and regiments arrayed, each under its own
      banner. His Greatheart, his Captain Boanerges, and his Captain Credence,
      are evidently portraits, of which the originals were among those martial
      saints who fought and expounded in Fairfax&rsquo;s army.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few months Bunyan returned home and married. His wife had some pious
      relations, and brought him as her only portion some pious books. And now
      his mind, excitable by nature, very imperfectly disciplined by education,
      and exposed, without any protection, to the infections virulence of the
      enthusiasm which was then epidemic in England, began to be fearfully
      disordered. In outward things he soon became a strict Pharisee. He was
      constant in attendance at prayers and sermons. His favourite amusements
      were <span class="pagenum">136</span><a name="link136" id="link136"></a>one
      after another relinquished, though not without many painful smuggles. In
      the middle of a game at tipcat he paused, and stood staring wildly upwards
      with his stick in his hand. He had heard a voice asking him whether he
      would leave his sins and go to heaven, or keep his sins and go to hell;
      and he had seen an awful countenance frowning on him from the sky. The
      odious vice of bell-ringing he renounced: but he still for a time ventured
      to so to the church tower and look on while others pulled the ropes. But
      soon the thought struck him that, if he persisted in such wickedness, the
      steeple would fall on his head; and he fled in terror from the accursed
      place. To give up dancing on the village green was still harder; and some
      months elapsed before he had the fortitude to part with this darling sin.
      When this last sacrifice had been made, he was, even when tried by the
      maxims of that austere time, faultless. All Elstow talked of him as an
      eminently pious youth. But his own mind was more unquiet than ever. Having
      nothing more to do in the way of visible reformation, yet finding in
      religion no pleasures to supply the place of the juvenile amusements which
      he had relinquished, he began to apprehend that he lay under some special
      malediction; and he was tormented by a succession of fantasies which
      seemed likely to drive him to suicide or to Bedlam.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time he took it into his head that all persons of Israelite blood
      would be saved, and tried to make out that he partook of that blood; but
      his hopes were speedily destroyed by his father, who seems to have had no
      ambition to be regarded as a Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time Bunyan was disturbed by a strange dilemma: &ldquo;If I have not
      faith, I am lost; if I have faith, <span class="pagenum">137</span><a
      name="link137" id="link137"></a>I can work miracles.&rdquo; He was tempted to
      cry to the puddles between Elstow and Bedford, &ldquo;Be ye dry,&rdquo; and to stake
      his eternal hopes on the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took up a notion that the day of grace for Bedford and the
      neighbouring villages was past; that all who were to be saved in that part
      of England were already converted; and that he had begun to pray and
      strive some months too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was harassed by doubts whether the Turks were not in the right,
      and the Christians in the wrong. Then he was troubled by a maniacal
      impulse which prompted him to pray to the trees, to a broomstick, to the
      parish bull. As yet, however, he was only entering the Valley of the
      Shadow of Death. Soon the darkness grew thicker. Hideous forms floated
      before him. Sounds of cursing and wailing were in his ears. His way ran
      through stench and fire, close to the mouth of the bottomless pit. He
      began to be haunted by a strange curiosity about the unpardonable sin, and
      by a morbid longing to commit it. But the most frightful of all the forms
      which his disease took was a propensity to utter blasphemy, and especially
      to renounce his share in the benefits of the redemption. Night and day, in
      bed, at table, at work, evil spirits, as he imagined, were repeating close
      to his ear the words, &ldquo;Sell him, sell him.&rdquo; He struck at the hobgoblins;
      he pushed them from him; but still they were ever at his side. He cried
      out in answer to them, hour after hour: &ldquo;Never, never; not for thousands
      of worlds; not for thousands.&rdquo; At length, worn out by this long agony, he
      suffered the fatal words to escape him, &ldquo;Let him go, if he will.&rdquo; Then his
      misery became more fearful than ever. He had done what could not be
      forgiven. He had forfeited his part of <span class="pagenum">138</span><a
      name="link138" id="link138"></a>the great sacrifice. Like Esau, he had
      sold his birthright; and there was no longer any place for repentance.
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; he afterwards wrote, &ldquo;knows the terrors of those days but myself.&rdquo;
       he has described his sufferings with singular energy, simplicity, and
      pathos, he envied the brutes; he envied the very stones in the street, and
      the tiles on the houses. The sun seemed to withhold its light and warmth
      from him. His body, though cast in a sturdy mould, and though still in the
      highest vigour of youth, trembled whole days together with the fear of
      death and judgment. He fancied that this trembling was the sign set on the
      worst reprobates, the sign which God had put on Cain. The unhappy man&rsquo;s
      emotion destroyed his power of digestion. He had such pains that he
      expected to burst asunder like Judas, whom he regarded as his prototype.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the books which Bunyan read, nor the advisers whom he consulted,
      were likely to do much good in a case like his. His small library had
      received a most unseasonable addition, the account of the lamentable end
      of Francis Spira. One ancient man of high repute for piety, whom the
      sufferer consulted, gave an opinion which might well have produced fatal
      consequences. &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Bunyan, &ldquo;that I have committed the sin
      against the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the old fanatic, &ldquo;I am afraid that you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length the clouds broke; the light became clearer and clearer; and the
      enthusiast, who had imagined that he was branded with the mark of the
      first murderer, and destined to the end of the arch traitor, enjoyed peace
      and a cheerful confidence in the mercy of God. Years elapsed, however,
      before his nerves, which had been so perilously overstrained, recovered
      their tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <span class="pagenum">139</span><a name="link139" id="link139"></a>he
      had joined a Baptist society at Bedford, and was for the first time
      admitted to partake of the Eucharist, it was with difficulty that he could
      refrain from imprecating destruction on his brethren while the cup was
      passing from hand to hand. After he had been some time a member of the
      congregation, he began to preach; and his sermons produced a powerful
      effect. He was indeed illiterate; but he spoke to illiterate men. The
      severe training through which he had passed had given him such an
      experimental knowledge of all the modes of religious melancholy as he
      could never have gathered from books; and his vigorous genius, animated by
      a fervent spirit of devotion, enabled him, not only to exercise a great
      influence over the vulgar, but even to extort the half contemptuous
      admiration of scholars. Yet it was long before he ceased to be tormented
      by an impulse which urged him to utter words of horrible impiety in the
      pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Counter-irritants are of as great use in moral as in physical diseases. It
      should seem that Bunyan was finally relieved from the internal sufferings
      which had embittered his life by sharp persecution from without. He had
      been five years a preacher, when the Restoration put it in the power of
      the Cavalier gentlemen and clergymen all over the country to oppress the
      Dissenters; and, of all the Dissenters whose history is known to us, he
      was perhaps the most hardly treated. In November 1660, he was flung into
      Bedford gaol; and there he remained, with some intervals of partial and
      precarious liberty, during twelve years. His persecutors tried to extort
      from him a promise that he would abstain from preaching; but he was
      convinced that he was divinely set apart and commissioned to be a teacher
      of righteousness: and he was fully <span class="pagenum">140</span><a
      name="link140" id="link140"></a>determined to obey God rather than man. He
      was brought before several tribunals, laughed at, caressed, reviled,
      menaced, but in vain. He was facetiously told that he was quite right in
      thinking that he ought not to hide his gift: but that his real gift was
      skill in repairing old kettles. He was compared to Alexander the
      coppersmith. he was told that, if he would give up preaching, he should be
      instantly liberated. He was warned that, if he persisted in disobeying the
      law, he would be liable to banishment, and that, if he were found in
      England after a certain time, his neck would be stretched. His answer was,
      &ldquo;If you let me out to-day, I will preach again tomorrow.&rdquo; Year after year
      he lay patiently in a dungeon, compared with which the worst prison now to
      be found in the island is a palace. His fortitude is the more
      extraordinary, because his domestic feelings were unusually strong.
      Indeed, he was considered by his stern brethren as somewhat too fond and
      indulgent a parent. He had several small children, and among them a
      daughter who was blind, and whom he loved with peculiar tenderness. He
      could not, he said, bear even to let the wind blow on her; and now she
      must suffer cold and hunger: she must beg; she must be beaten; &ldquo;yet,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I must, I must do it.&rdquo; While he lay in prison he could do nothing
      in the way of his old trade for the support of his family. He determined,
      therefore, to take up a new trade. He learned to make long tagged thread
      laces; and many thousands of these articles were furnished by him to the
      hawkers. While his hands were thus busied, he had other employment for his
      mind and his lips. He gave religious instruction to his fellow-captives,
      and formed from among them a little flock, of which he <span
      class="pagenum">141</span><a name="link141" id="link141"></a>was himself
      the pastor. He studied indefatigably the few books which he possessed. His
      two chief companions were the Bible and Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs. His
      knowledge of the Bible was such that he might have been called a living
      concordance; and on the margin of his copy of the Book of Martyrs are
      still legible the ill spelt lines of doggrel in which he expressed his
      reverence for the brave sufferers, and his implacable enmity to the
      mystical Babylon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he began to write; and, though it was some time before he
      discovered where his strength lay, his writings were not unsuccessful.
      They were coarse, indeed; but they showed a keen mother wit, a great
      command of the homely mother tongue, an intimate knowledge of the English
      Bible, and a vast and dearly bought spiritual experience. They therefore,
      when the corrector of the press had improved the syntax and the spelling,
      were well received by the humbler class of Dissenters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of Bunyan&rsquo;s time was spent in controversy. He wrote sharply against
      the Quakers, whom he seems always to have held in utter abhorrence. It is,
      however, a remarkable fact that he adopted one of their peculiar fashions:
      his practice was to write, not November or December, but eleventh month
      and twelfth month.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote against the liturgy of the Church of England. No two things,
      according to him, had less affinity than the form of prayer and the spirit
      of prayer. Those, he said with much point, who have most of the spirit of
      prayer are all to be found in gaol; and those who have most zeal for the
      form of prayer are all to be found at the alehouse. The doctrinal
      articles, on the other hand, he warmly praised, and defended against some
      <span class="pagenum">142</span><a name="link142" id="link142"></a>Arminian
      clergymen who had signed them. The most acrimonious of all his works is
      his answer to Edward Fowler, afterwards Bishop of Gloucester, an excellent
      man, but not free from the taint of Pelagianisin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banyan had also a dispute with some of the chiefs of the sect to which he
      belonged. He doubtless held with perfect sincerity the distinguishing
      tenet of that sect; but he did not consider that tenet as one of high
      importance, and willingly joined in communion with quiet Presbyterians and
      Independents. The sterner Baptists, therefore, loudly pronounced him a
      false brother. A controversy arose which long survived the original
      combatants. In our own time the cause which Bunyan had defended with rude
      logic and rhetoric against Kiffin and Danvers was pleaded by Robert Hall
      with an ingenuity and eloquence such as no polemical Writer has ever
      surpassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the years which immediately followed the
    </p>
    <p>
      Restoration, Bunyan&rsquo;s confinement seems to have been strict. But, as the
      passions of 1660 cooled, as the hatred with which the Puritans had been
      regarded while their reign was recent gave place to pity, he was less and
      less harshly treated. The distress of his family, and his own patience,
      courage, and piety softened the hearts of his persecutors. Like his own
      Christian in the cage, he found protectors even among the crowd of Vanity
      Fair. The bishop of the diocese, Dr. Barlow, is said to have interceded
      for him. At length the prisoner was suffered to pass most of his time
      beyond the walls of the gaol, on condition, as it should seem, that he
      remained within the town of Bedford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He owed his complete liberation to one of the worst acts of one of the
      worst governments that England has ever <span class="pagenum">143</span><a
      name="link143" id="link143"></a>seen. In 1671 the Cabal was in power.
      Charles II. had concluded the treaty by which he bound himself to set up
      the Roman Catholic religion in England. The first step which he took
      towards that end was to annul, by an unconstitutional exercise of his
      prerogative, all the penal statutes against the Roman Catholics; and, in
      order to disguise his real design, he annulled at the same time the penal
      statutes against Protestant nonconformists. Bunyan was consequently set at
      large. In the first warmth of his gratitude he published a tract in which
      he compared Charles to that humane and generous Persian king who, though
      not himself blessed with the light of the true religion, favoured the
      chosen people, and permitted them, after years of captivity, to rebuild
      their beloved temple. To candid men, who consider how much Bunyan had
      suffered, and how little he could guess the secret designs of the court,
      the unsuspicious thankfulness with which he accepted the precious boon of
      freedom will not appear to require any apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he left his prison he had begun the book which has made his nane
      immortal. The history of that book is remarkable. The author was, as he
      tells us, writing a treatise, in which he had occasion to speak of the
      stages of the Christian progress. He compared that progress, as many
      others had compared it, to a pilgrimage. Soon his quick wit discovered
      innumerable points of similarity which had escaped his predecessors. Imams
      came crowding on his mind faster than he could put them into words,
      quagmires and pits, steep hills, dark and horrible glens, soft vales,
      sunny pastures, a gloomy castle of which the courtyard was strewn with the
      skulls and bones of murdered prisoners, a town all bustle and splendour,
      like London on the Lord <span class="pagenum">144</span><a name="link144"
       id="link144"></a>Mayor&rsquo;s Day, and the narrow path, straight as a rule
      could make it, running on up hill and down hill, through city and through
      wilderness, to the Black River and the Shining Gate. He had found out, as
      most people would have said, by accident, as he would doubtless have said,
      by the guidance of Providence, where his powers lay. He had no suspicion,
      indeed, that he was producing a masterpiece. He could not guess what place
      his allegory would occupy in English literature; for of English literature
      he knew nothing. Those who suppose him to have studied the Fairy Queen
      might easily be confuted, if this were the proper place for a detailed
      examination of the passages in which the two allegories have been thought
      to resemble each other. The only work of fiction, in all probability, with
      which he could compare his pilgrim, was his old favourite, the legend of
      Sir Bevis of Southampton. He would have thought it a sin to borrow any
      time from the serious business of his life, from his expositions, his
      controversies, and his lace tags, for the purpose of amusing himself with
      what he considered merely as a trifle. It was only, he assures us, at
      spare moments that he returned to the House Beautiful, the Delectable
      Mountains, and the Enchanted Ground. He had no assistance. Nobody but
      himself saw a line till the whole was complete. He then consulted his
      pious friends. Some were pleased. Others were much scandalised. It was a
      vain story, a mere romance, about giants, and lions, and goblins, and
      warriors, sometimes fighting with monsters and sometimes regaled by fair
      ladies in stately palaces. The loose atheistical wits at Will&rsquo;s might
      write such stuff to divert the painted Jezebels of the court: but did it
      become a minister of the gospel to copy the evil fashions of the world?
      There had <span class="pagenum">145</span><a name="link145" id="link145"></a>been
      a time when the cant of such fools would have made Bunyan miserable. But
      that time was passed; and his mind was now in a firm and healthy state. He
      saw that, in employing fiction to make truth clear and goodness
      attractive, he was only following the example which every Christian ought
      to propose to himself; and he determined to print.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> stole silently into the world. Not a single
      copy of the first edition is known to be in existence. The year of
      publication has not been ascertained. It is probable that, during some
      months, the little volume circulated only among poor and obscure
      sectaries. But soon the irresistible charm of a book which gratified the
      imagination of the reader with all the action and scenery of a fairy tale,
      which exercised Ins ingenuity by setting him to discover a multitude of
      curious analogies, which interested his feelings for human beings, frail
      like himself, and struggling with temptations from within and from
      without, which every moment drew a smile from him by some stroke of quaint
      yet simple pleasantry, and nevertheless left on his mind a sentiment of
      reverence for God and of sympathy for man, began to produce its effect. In
      puritanical circles, from which plays and novels were strictly excluded,
      that effect was such as no work of genius, though it were superior to the
      Iliad, to Don Quixote, or to Othello, can ever produce on a mind
      accustomed to indulge in literary luxury. In 1678 came forth a second
      edition with additions; and then the demand became immense. In the four
      following years the book was reprinted six times. The eighth edition,
      which contains the last improvements made by the author, was published in
      1682, the ninth in 1684, the tenth in 1685. The help of the engraver had
      early been <span class="pagenum">146</span><a name="link146" id="link146"></a>called
      in; and tens of thousands of children looked with terror and delight on
      execrable copperplates, which represented Christian thrusting his sword
      into Apollyon, or writhing in the grasp of Giant Despair. In Scotland, and
      in some of the colonies, the Pilgrim was even more popular than in his
      native country. Bunyan has told us, with very pardonable vanity, that in
      New England his dream was the daily subject of the conversation of
      thousands, and was thought worthy to appear in the most superb binding. He
      had numerous admirers in Holland, and amoung the Huegonots of France. With
      the pleasures, however, he experienced some of the pains of eminence.
      Knavish booksellers put forth volumes of trash under his name; and envious
      scribblers maintained it to be impossible that the poor ignorant tinker
      should really be the author of the book which was called his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the best way to confound both those who counterfeited him and
      those who slandered him. He continued to work the gold-field which he had
      discovered, and to draw from it new treasures, not indeed with quite such
      ease and in quite such abundance as when the precious soil was still
      virgin, but yet with success which left all competition far behind. In
      1684 appeared the second part of the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rdquo; It was soon
      followed by the &ldquo;Holy War,&rdquo; which, if the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; did not
      exist, would be the best allegory that ever was written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bunyan&rsquo;s place in society was now very different from what it had been.
      There had been a time when many Dissenting ministers, who could talk Latin
      and read Greek, had affected to treat him with scorn. But his fame and
      influence now far exceeded theirs. He had so great an authority among the
      Baptists that he was popularly <span class="pagenum">147</span><a
      name="link147" id="link147"></a>called Bishop Banyan. His episcopal
      visitations were annual. From Bedford he rode every year to London, and
      preached there to large and attentive congregations. From London he went
      his circuit through the country, animating the zeal of his brethren,
      collecting and distributing alms, and making up quarrels. The magistrates
      seem in general to have given him little trouble. But there is reason to
      believe that, in the year 1685, he was in some danger of again occupying
      his old quarters in Bedford gaol. In that year the rash and wicked
      enterprise of Monmouth gave the Government a pretext for prosecuting the
      Nonconformists; and scarcely one eminent divine of the Presbyterian,
      Independent, or Baptist persuasion remained unmolested. Baxter was in
      prison: Howe was driven into exile: Henry was arrested. Two eminent
      Baptists, with whom Bunyan had been engaged in controversy, were in great
      peril and distress. Danvers was in danger of being hanged: and Kiffin&rsquo;s
      grandsons were actually hanged. The tradition is that, during those evil
      days, Bunyan was forced to disguise himself as a waggoner, and that he
      preached to his congregation at Bedford in a smock-frock, with a cart-whip
      in his hand. But soon a great change took place. James the Second was at
      open war with the church, and found it necessary to court the Dissenters.
      Some of the creatures of the government tried to secure the aid of Bunyan.
      They probably knew that he had written in praise of the indulgence of
      1672, and therefore hoped that he might be equally pleased with the
      indulgence of 1687. But fifteen years of thought, observation, and
      commerce with the world had made him wiser. Nor were the cases exactly
      parallel. Charles was a professed Protestant: James was a <span
      class="pagenum">148</span><a name="link148" id="link148"></a>professed
      Papist. The object of Charles&rsquo;s indulgence was disguised: the object of
      James&rsquo;s indulgence was patent. Bunyan was not deceived, he exhorted his
      hearers to prepare themselves by fasting and prayer for the danger which
      menaced their civil and religious liberties, and refused even to speak to
      the courtier who came down to remodel the corporation of Bedford, and who,
      as was supposed, had it in charge to offer some municipal dignity to the
      Bishop of the Baptists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bunyan did not live to see the Revolution. In the summer of 1688 he
      undertook to plead the cause of a son with an angry father, and at length
      prevailed on the old man not to disinherit the young one. This good work
      cost the benevolent intercessor his life. He had to ride through heavy
      rain. He came drenched to his lodgings on Snow Hill, was seized with a
      violent fever, and died in a few days. He was buried in Bunhill Fields;
      and the spot where he lies is still regarded by the Nonconformists with a
      feeling which, seems scarcely in harmony with the stern spirit of their
      theology. Many puritans, to whom the respect paid by Roman Catholics to
      the reliques and tombs of saints seemed childish or sinful, are said to
      have begged with their dying breath that their coffins might be placed as
      near as possible to the coffin of the author of the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fame of Bunyan during his life, and during the century which followed
      his death, was indeed great, but was almost entirely confined to religious
      families of the middle and lower classes. Very seldom was he during that
      time mentioned with respect by any writer of great literary eminence.
      Young coupled his prose with the poetry of the wretched D&rsquo;Urfey. In the
      Spiritual Quixote, the adventures of Christian are ranked <span
      class="pagenum">149</span><a name="link149" id="link149"></a>with those of
      Jack the Giant-Killer and John Hickathrift. Cowper ventured to praise the
      great allegorist, but did not venture to name him. It is a significant
      circumstance that, till a recent period, all the numerous editions of the
      &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; were evidently meant for the cottage and the
      servants&rsquo; hall. The paper, the printing, the plates, were all of the
      meanest description. In general, when the educated minority and the common
      people differ about the merit of a book, the opinion of the educated
      minority finally prevails. The &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; is perhaps the only
      book about which, after the lapse of a hundred years, the educated
      minority has come over to the opinion of the common people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempts which have been made to improve and to imitate this book are
      not to be numbered. It has been done into verse: it has been done into
      modern English. &ldquo;The Pilgrimage of Tender Conscience,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Pilgrimage of
      Good Intent,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pilgrimage of Seek Truth,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pilgrimage of
      Theophilus,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Infant Pilgrim,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hindoo Pilgrim,&rdquo; are among the
      many feeble copies of the great original. But the peculiar glory of Bunyan
      is that those who most hated his doctrines have tried to borrow the help
      of his genius. A Catholic version of his parable may be seen with the head
      of the Virgin in the title page. On the other hand, those Antinomians for
      whom his Calvinism is not strong enough may study the pilgrimage of
      Hephzibah, in which nothing will be found which can be construed into an
      admission of free agency and universal redemption. But the most
      extraordinary of all the acts of Vandalism by which a fine work of art was
      ever defaced was committed so late as the year 1853. It was determined to
      transform <span class="pagenum">150</span><a name="link150" id="link150"></a>the
      &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; into a Tractarian book. The task was not easy: for it
      was necessary to make the two sacraments the most prominent objects in the
      allegory; and of all Christian theologians, avowed Quakers excepted,
      Bunyan was the one in whose system the sacraments held the least prominent
      place. However, the Wicket Gate became a type of Baptism, and the House
      Beautiful of the Eucharist. The effect of this change is such as assuredly
      the ingenious person who made it never contemplated. For, as not a single
      pilgrim passes through the Wicket Gate in infancy, and as Faithful hurries
      past the House Beautiful without stopping, the lesson, which the fable in
      its altered shape teaches, is that none but adults ought to be baptized,
      and that the Eucharist may safely be neglected. Nobody would have
      discovered from the original &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; that the author was not
      a Pædobaptist. To turn his book into a book against Pædobaptism was an
      achievement reserved for an Anglo-Catholic divine. Such blunders must
      necessarily be committed by every man who mutilates parts of a great work,
      without taking a comprehensive view of the whole.

    <h2>
      OLIVER GOLDSMITH.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, February 1856.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>liver Goldsmith,
      <span class="pagenum">151</span><a name="link151" id="link151"></a>one of
      the most pleasing English writers of the eighteenth century. He was of a
      Protestant and Saxon family which had been long settled in Ireland, and
      which had, like most other Protestant and Saxon families, been, in
      troubled times, harassed and put in fear by the native population. His
      father, Charles Goldsmith, studied in the reign of Queen Anne at the
      diocesan school of Elphin, became attached to the daughter of the
      schoolmaster, married her, took orders, and settled at a place called
      Pallas in the county of Longford. There he with difficulty supported his
      wife and children on what he could earn, partly as a curate and partly as
      a farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Pallas Oliver Goldsmith was born in November 1728. The spot was then,
      for all practical purposes, almost as remote from the busy and splendid
      capital in which his later years were passed, as any clearing in Upper
      Canada or any sheep-walk in Australasia now is. Even at this day those
      enthusiasts who venture to make a pilgrimage to the birthplace of the poet
      are forced to perform the latter part of their journey on foot. The hamlet
      lies far from any high road, on a dreary plain which, in wet weather, is
      often a lake. <span class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152"
       id="link152"></a>The lanes would break any jaunting ear to pieces; and
      there are ruts and sloughs through which the most strongly built wheels
      cannot be dragged.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Oliver was still a child, his father was presented to a living worth
      about 200l. a year, in the county of Westmeath. The family accordingly
      quitted their cottage in the wilderness for a spacious house on a
      frequented road, near the village of Lissoy. Here the boy was taught his
      letters by a maid-servant, and was sent in his seventh year to a village
      school kept by an old quartermaster on half-pay, who professed to teach
      nothing but reading, writing and arithmetic, but who had an inexhaustible
      fund of stories about ghosts, banshees and fairies, about the great
      Rapparee chiefs, Baldearg O&rsquo;Donnell and galloping Hogan, and about the
      exploits of Peterborough and Stanhope, the surprise of Monjuich, and the
      glorious disaster of Brihuega.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man must have been of the Protestant religion; but he was of the
      aboriginal race, and not only spoke the Irish language, but could pour
      forth unpremeditated Irish verses. Oliver early became, and through life
      continued to be, a passionate admirer of the Irish music, and especially
      of the compositions of Carolan, some of the last notes of whose harp he
      heard. It ought to be added that Oliver, though by birth one of the
      Englishry, and though connected by numerous ties with the Established
      Church, never showed the least sign of that contemptuous antipathy with
      which, in his days, the ruling minority in Ireland too generally regarded
      the subject majority. So far indeed was he from sharing in the opinions
      and feelings of the caste to which he belonged, that he conceived an
      aversion to the Glorious and Immortal Memory, and, even when George the
      Third was on the throne, maintained <span class="pagenum">153</span><a
      name="link153" id="link153"></a>that nothing but the restoration of the
      banished dynasty could save the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the humble academy kept by the old soldier Goldsmith was removed in
      his ninth year. He went to several grammar-schools, and acquired some
      knowledge of the ancient languages. His life at this time seems to have
      been far from happy. He had, as appears from the admirable portrait of him
      at Knowle, features harsh even to ugliness. The small-pox had set its mark
      on him with more than usual severity. His stature was small, and his limbs
      ill put together. Among boys little tenderness is shown to personal
      defects; and the ridicule excited by poor Oliver&rsquo;s appearance was
      heightened by a peculiar simplicity and a disposition to blunder which he
      retained to the last. He became the common butt of boys and masters, was
      pointed at as a fright in the play-ground, and flogged as a dunce in the
      school-room. When he had risen to eminence, those who had once derided him
      ransacked their memory for the events of his early years, and recited
      repartees and couplets which had dropped from him, and which, though
      little noticed at the time, were supposed, a quarter of a century later,
      to indicate the powers which produced the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield&rdquo; and the
      &ldquo;Deserted Village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his seventeenth year Oliver went up to Trinity College, Dublin, as a
      sizar. The sizars paid nothing for food and tuition, and very little for
      lodging; but they had to perform some menial services from which they have
      long been relieved. They swept the court: they carried up the dinner to
      the fellows&rsquo; table, and changed the plates and poured out the ale of the
      rulers of the society. Goldsmith was quartered, not alone, in a garret, on
      the window of which <span class="pagenum">154</span><a name="link154"
       id="link154"></a>his name, scrawled by himself, is still read with
      interest. (1) From such garrots many men of less parts than his have made
      their way to the wool-sack or to the episcopal bench. But Goldsmith, while
      he suffered all the humiliations, threw away all the advantages, of his
      situation. He neglected the studies of the place, stood low at the
      examinations, was turned down to the bottom of his class for playing the
      buffoon in the lecture room, was severely reprimanded for pumping on a
      constable, and was caned by a brutal tutor for giving a ball in the attic
      story of the college to some gay youths and damsels from the city.

      While Oliver was leading at Dublin a life divided between squalid distress
      and squalid dissipation, his father died, leaving a mere pittance. The
      youth obtained his bachelor&rsquo;s degree, and left the university. Durum some
      time the humble dwelling to which his widowed mother had retired was his
      home. He was now in his twenty-first year; it was necessary that he should
      do something; and his education seemed to have fitted him to do nothing
      but to dress himself in gaudy colours, of which he was as fond as a
      magpie, to take a hand at cards, to sing Irish airs, to play the flute, to
      angle in summer, and to tell ghost stories by the fire in winter. He tried
      five or six professions in turn without success. He applied for
      ordination; but, as he applied in scarlet clothes, he was speedily turned
      out of the episcopal palace. He then became tutor in an opulent family,
      but soon quitted his situation in consequence of a dispute about play.
      Then he determined

      to <span class="pagenum">155</span><a name="link155" id="link155"></a>emigrate
      to America. His relations, with much satisfaction, saw him set out for
      Cork on a good horse, with thirty pounds in his pocket. But in six weeks
      he came back on a miserable hack, without a penny, and informed his mother
      that the ship in which he had taken his passage, having got a fair wind
      while he was at a party of pleasure, had sailed without him. Then he
      resolved to study the law. A generous kinsman advanced fifty pounds. With
      this sum Goldsmith went to Dublin, was enticed into a gaming house, and
      lost every shilling. He then thought of medicine. A small purse was made
      up; and in his twenty-fourth year he was sent to Edinburgh. At Edinburgh
      he passed eighteen months in nominal attendance on lectures, and picked up
      some superficial information about chemistry and natural history. Thence
      he went to Leyden, still pretending to study physic. He left that
      celebrated university, the third university at which he had resided, in
      his twenty-seventh year, without a degree, with the merest smattering of
      medical knowledge, and with no property but his clothes and his flute. His
      flute, however, proved a useful friend. He rambled on foot through
      Flanders, France, and Switzerland, playing tunes which everywhere set the
      peasantry dancing, and which often procured for him a supper and a bed. He
      wandered as far as Italy. His musical performances, indeed, were not to
      the taste of the Italians; but he contrived to live on the alms whieh he
      obtained at the gates of convents. It should, however, be observed that
      the stories which he told about this part of his life ought to be received
      with great caution; for strict veracity was never one of his virtues; and
      a man who is ordinarily inaccurate in narration is likely to be more than
      ordinarily inaccurate when he talks about his <span class="pagenum">156</span><a
      name="link156" id="link156"></a>own travels. Goldsmith, indeed, was so
      regardless of truth as to assert in print that he was present at a most
      interesting conversation between Voltaire and Foutenelle, and that this
      conversation took place at Paris. Now it is certain that Voltaire never
      was within a hundred leagues of Paris during the whole time which
      Goldsmith passed on the Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1756 the wanderer landed at Dover, without a shilling, without a
      friend, and without a calling. He had, indeed, if his own unsupported
      evidence may be trusted, obtained from the university of Padua a doctor&rsquo;s
      degree; but this dignity proved utterly useless to him. In England his
      flute was not in request: there were no convents; and he was forced to
      have recourse to a series of desperate expedients. He turned strolling
      player; but his face and figure were ill suited to the boards even of the
      humblest theatre. He pounded drugs and ran about London with phials for
      charitable chemists. He joined a swarm of beggars, which made its nest in
      Axe Yard. He was for a time usher of a school, and felt the miseries and
      humiliations of this situation so keenly that he thought it a promotion to
      be permitted to earn his bread as a bookseller&rsquo;s hack; but he soon found
      the new yoke more galling than the old one, and was glad to become an
      usher again. He obtained a medical appointment in the service of the East
      India Company; but the appointment was speedily revoked. Why it was
      revoked we are not told. The subject was one on which he never liked to
      talk. It is probable that he was incompetent to perform the duties of the
      place. Then he presented himself at Surgeons&rsquo; Hall for examination, as
      mate to a naval hospital. Even to so humble a post he was found unequal.
      By this time the schoolmaster whom he had served for a morsel <span
      class="pagenum">157</span><a name="link157" id="link157"></a>of food and
      the third part of a bed was no more. Nothing remained but to return to the
      lowest drudgery of literature. Goldsmith took a garret in a miserable
      court, to which he had to climb from the brink of Fleet Ditch by a dizzy
      ladder of flag-stones called Breakneck Steps. The court and the ascent
      have long disappeared; but old Londoners will remember both. (1) Here, at
      thirty, the unlucky adventurer sat down to toil like a galley slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the succeeding six years he sent to the press some things which have
      survived and many which have perished. He produced articles for reviews,
      magazines, and newspapers: children&rsquo;s books which, bound in gilt paper and
      adorned with hideous woodcuts, appeared in the window of the once
      far-finned shop at the corner of St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard; &ldquo;An Inquiry into
      the State of Polite Learning in Europe,&rdquo; which, though of little or no
      value, is still reprinted among his works; a &ldquo;Life of Beau Nash,&rdquo; which is
      not reprinted, though it well deserves to be so; (2) a superficial and
      incorrect, but very readable, &ldquo;History of England,&rdquo; in a series of letters
      purporting to be addressed by a nobleman to his son; and some very lively
      and amusing &ldquo;Sketches of London Society,&rdquo; in a series of letters
      purporting to be addressed by a Chinese traveller to his friends. All
      these works were anonymous; but some of them were

     (1) A gentleman, who states that he has known the
     neighbourhood for thirty years, corrects this account, and
     informs the present publisher that the Breakneck Steps,
     thirty-two in number, divided into two flights, are still in
     existence, and that, according to tradition, Goldsmith&rsquo;s
     house was not on the steps, but was the first house at the
     head of the court, on the left hand, going from the Old
     Bailey. See <i>Notes and Queries</i> (2nd S. ix. 280).

     (2) Mr. Black has pointed out that this is inaccurate: the
     life of Nash has been twice reprinted; once in  Mr. Prior&rsquo;s

     edition (vol. iv. p. 351.
</pre>
    <p>
      well <span class="pagenum">158</span><a name="link158" id="link158"></a>known
      to be Goldsmith&rsquo;s: and he gradually rose in the estimation of the
      booksellers for whom he drudged. He was, indeed, emphatically a popular
      writer. For accurate research or grave disquisition he was not well
      qualified by nature or by education, he knew nothing accurately: his
      reading had been desultory; nor had he meditated deeply on what he had
      read. He had seen much of the world; but he had noticed and retained
      little more of what he had seen than some grotesque incidents and
      characters which had happened to strike his fancy. But, though his mind
      was very scantily stored with materials, he used what materials he had in
      such a way as to produce a wonderful effect. There have been many greater
      writers; but perhaps no writer was ever more uniformly agreeable. His
      style was always pure and easy, and, on proper occasions, pointed and
      energetic. His narratives were always amusing, his descriptions always
      picturesque, his humour rich and joyous, yet not without an occasional
      tinge of amiable sadness. About everything that he wrote, serious or
      sportive, there was a certain natural grace and decorum, hardly to be
      expected from a man a great part of whose life had been passed among
      thieves and beggars, street-walkers and merry andrews, in those squalid
      dens which are the reproach of great capitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his name gradually became known, the circle of his acquaintance
      widened. He was introduced to Johnson, who was then considered as the
      first of living English writers; to Reynolds, the first of English
      painters; and to Burke, who had not yet entered parliament, but had
      distinguished himself greatly by his writings and by the eloquence of his
      conversation. With these eminent men Goldsmith became intimate. In 1763 he
      was <span class="pagenum">159</span><a name="link159" id="link159"></a>one
      of the nine original members of that celebrated fraternity which has
      sometimes been called the Literary Club, but which has always disclaimed
      that epithet, and still glories in the simple name of The Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Goldsmith had quitted his miserable dwelling at the top of
      Breakneck Steps, and had taken chambers in the more civilised region of
      the Inns of Court. But he was still often reduced to pitiable shifts.
      Towards the close of 1764 his rent was so long in arrear that his landlady
      one morning called in the help of a sheriff&rsquo;s officer. The debtor, in
      great perplexity, despatched a messenger to Johnson; and Johnson, always
      friendly, though often surly, sent back the messenger with a guinea, and
      promised to follow speedily. He came, and found that Goldsmith had changed
      the guinea, and was railing at the landlady over a bottle of Madeira.
      Johnson put the cork into the bottle, and entreated his friend to consider
      calmly how money was to be procured. Goldsmith said that he had a novel
      ready for the press. Johnson glanced at the manuscript, saw that there
      were good things in it, took it to a bookseller, sold it for 60l, and soon
      returned with the money. The rent was paid; and the sheriff&rsquo;s officer
      withdrew. According to one story, Goldsmith gave his landlady a sharp
      reprimand for her treatment of him; according to another, he insisted on
      her joining him in a bowl of punch. Both stories are probably true. The
      novel which was thus ushered into the world was the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, before the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield&rdquo; appeared in print, came the great
      crisis of Goldsmith&rsquo;s literary life. In Christmas week, 1764, he published
      a poem, entitled the &ldquo;Traveller.&rdquo; It was the first work to which he had
      <span class="pagenum">160</span><a name="link160" id="link160"></a>put,
      his name; and it at once raised him to the rank of a legitimate English
      classic. The opinion of the most skilful critics was, that nothing finer
      had appeared in verse since the fourth book of the &ldquo;Dunciad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one respect the &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; differs from all Goldsmith&rsquo;s other
      writings. In general his designs were bad, and his execution good. In the
      &ldquo;Traveller,&rdquo; the execution, though deserving of much praise, is far
      inferior to the design. No philosophical poem, ancient or modern, lias a
      plan so noble, and at the same time so simple. An English, wanderer,
      seated on a crag among the Alps, near the point where three great
      countries meet, looks down on the boundless prospect, reviews his long
      pilgrimage, recalls the varieties of scenery, of climate, of government,
      of religion, of national character, which he has observed, and comes to
      the conclusion, just or unjust, that our happiness depends little on
      political institutions, and much on the temper and regulation of our own
      minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the fourth edition of the &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; was on the counters of the
      booksellers, the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield&rdquo; appeared, and rapidly obtained a
      popularity which has lasted down to our own time, and which is likely to
      last as long as our language. The fable is indeed one of the worst that
      ever was constructed. It wants, not merely that probability which ought to
      be found in a tale of common English life, but that consistency which
      ought to be found even in the wildest fiction about witches, giants, and
      fairies. But the earlier chapters have all the Sweetness of pastoral
      poetry, together with all the vivacity of comedy. Moses and his
      spectacles, the vicar and his monogamy, the sharper and his cosmogony, the
      squire proving from Aristotle that relatives are related, Olivia preparing
      <span class="pagenum">161</span><a name="link161" id="link161"></a>herself
      for the arduous task of converting a rakish lover by studying the
      controversy between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, the great ladies with
      their scandal about Sir Tomkyn&rsquo;s amours and Dr. Burdock&rsquo;s verses, and Mr.
      Burchell with his &ldquo;Fudge,&rdquo; have caused as much harmless mirth as has ever
      been caused by matter packed into so small a number of pages. The latter
      part of the tale is unworthy of the beginning. As we approach the
      catastrophe, the absurdities lie thicker and thicker; and the gleams of
      pleasantry become rarer and rarer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success which had attended Goldsmith as a novelist emboldened him to
      try his fortune as a dramatist. He wrote the &ldquo;Goodnatured Man,&rdquo; a piece
      which had a worse fate than it deserved. Garrick refused to produce it at
      Drury Lane. It was acted at Covent Garden in 1768, but was coldly
      received. The author, however, cleared by his benefit nights, and by the
      sale of the copyright, no less than 500l., five times as much as he had
      made by the &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield&rdquo; together. The plot of
      the &ldquo;Good-natured Man&rdquo; is, like almost all Goldsmith&rsquo;s plots, very ill
      constructed. But some passages are exquisitely ludicrous; much more
      ludicrous, indeed, than suited the taste of the town at that time. A
      canting, mawkish play, entitled &ldquo;False Delicacy,&rdquo; had just had an immense
      run. Sentimentality was all the mode. During some years, more tears were
      shed at comedies than at tragedies; and a pleasantry which moved the
      audience to anything more than a grave smile was reprobated as low. It is
      not strange, therefore, that the very best scene in the &ldquo;Goodnatured Man,&rdquo;
       that in which Miss Richland finds her lover attended by the bailiff and
      the bailiff&rsquo;s follower in full court dresses, should <span class="pagenum">162</span><a
      name="link162" id="link162"></a>have been mercilessly hissed, and should
      have been omitted after the first night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1770 appeared the &ldquo;Deserted Village.&rdquo; In mere diction and versification
      this celebrated poem is fully equal, perhaps superior, to the &ldquo;Traveller;&rdquo;
       and it is generally preferred to the &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; by that large class of
      readers who think, with Bayes in the &ldquo;Rehearsal,&rdquo; that the only use of a
      plan is to bring in fine things. More discerning judges, however, while
      they admire the beauty of the details, are shocked by one unpardonable
      fault which pervades the whole. The fault we mean is not that theory about
      wealth and luxury which has so often been censured by political
      economists. The theory is indeed false: but the poem, considered merely as
      a poem, is not necessarily the worse on that account. The finest poem in
      the Latin language, indeed the finest didactic poem in any language, was
      written in defence of the silliest and meanest of all systems of natural
      and moral philosophy. A poet may easily be pardoned for reasoning ill; but
      he cannot be pardoned for describing ill, for observing the world in which
      he lives so carelessly that his portraits bear no resemblance to the
      originals, for exhibiting as copies from real life monstrous combinations
      of things which never were and never could be found together. What would
      be thought of a painter who should mix August and January in one
      landscape, who should introduce a frozen river into a harvest scene? Would
      it be a sufficient defence of such a picture to say that every part was
      exquisitely coloured, that the green hedges, the apple-trees loaded with
      fruit, the waggons reeling under the yellow sheaves, and the sun-burned
      reapers wiping their foreheads, were very fine, and that the ice and the
      boys sliding were also very <span class="pagenum">163</span><a
      name="link163" id="link163"></a>fine? To such a picture the &ldquo;Deserted
      Village&rdquo; bears a great resemblance. It is made up of incongruous parts.
      The village in its happy days is a true English village. The village in
      its decay is an Irish village. The felicity and the misery which Goldsmith
      has brought close together belong to two different countries, and to two
      different stages in the progress of society. He had assuredly never seen
      in his native island such a rural paradise, such a seat of plenty,
      content, and tranquillity, as his &ldquo;Auburn.&rdquo; He had assuredly never seen in
      England all the inhabitants of such a paradise turned out of their homes
      in one day and forced to emigrate in a body to America. The hamlet he had
      probably seen in Kent; the ejectment he had probably seen in Minister:
      but, by joining the two, he has produced something which never was and
      never will be seen in any part of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1778 Goldsmith tried his chance at Covent Garden with a second play,
      &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer.&rdquo; The manager was not without great difficulty
      induced to bring this piece out. The sentimental comedy still reigned: and
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s comedies were not sentimental. The &ldquo;Goodnatured Man&rdquo; had been
      too funny to succeed; yet the mirth of the &ldquo;Goodnatured? Man&rdquo; was sober
      when compared with the rich drollery# of &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer,&rdquo; which
      is, in truth, an incomparable farce in five acts. On this occasion,
      however, genius triumphed. Pit, boxes, and galleries, were in a constant
      roar of laughter. If any bigoted admirer of Kelly and Cumberland ventured
      to hiss or groan, he was speedily silenced by a general cry of &ldquo;turn him
      out,&rdquo; or &ldquo;throw him over.&rdquo; Two generations have since confirmed the
      verdict which was pronounced on that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      While <span class="pagenum">164</span><a name="link164" id="link164"></a>Goldsmith
      was writing the &ldquo;Deserted Village&rdquo; and &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer,&rdquo; he was
      employed on works of a very different kind, works from which he derived
      little reputation but much profit, he compiled for the use of schools a
      &ldquo;History of Rome,&rdquo; by which he made 300l., a &ldquo;History of England,&rdquo; by
      which he made 500l., a &ldquo;History of Greece,&rdquo; for which he received 250l., a
      &ldquo;Natural History,&rdquo; for which the booksellers covenanted to pay him 800
      guineas. These works he produced without any elaborate research, by merely
      selecting, abridging, and translating into his own clear, pure, and
      flowing language what he found in books well known to the world, but too
      bulky or too dry for boys and girls. He committed some strange blunders;
      for he knew nothing with accuracy. Thus in his &ldquo;History of England&rdquo; he
      tells us that Naseby is in Yorkshire; nor did he correct this mistake when
      the book was reprinted. He was very nearly hoaxed into putting into the
      &ldquo;History of Greece&rdquo; an account of a battle between Alexander the Great and
      Montezuma. In his &ldquo;Animated Nature&rdquo; he relates, with faith and with
      perfect gravity, all the most absurd lies which he could find in books of
      travels about gigantic Patagonians, monkeys that preach sermons,
      nightingales that repeat long conversations. &ldquo;If he can tell a horse from
      a cow,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;that is the extent of his knowledge of zoology.&rdquo;
       How little Goldsmith was qualified to write about the physical sciences is
      sufficiently proved by two anecdotes. He on one occasion denied that the
      sun is longer in the northern than in the southern skies. It was vain to
      cite the authority of Maupertuis. &ldquo;Maupertuis!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I understand
      those matters better than Maupertuis.&rdquo; On another occasion he, <span
      class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165" id="link165"></a>in defiance
      of the evidence of his own senses, maintained obstinately, and even
      angrily, that he chewed his dinner by moving his upper jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, ignorant as Goldsmith was, few writers have done more to make the
      first steps in the laborious road to knowledge easy and pleasant. His
      compilations are widely distinguished from the compilations of ordinary
      book-makers. He was a great, perhaps an unequalled, master of the arts of
      selection and condensation. In these respects his histories of Rome and of
      England, and still more his own abridgments of these histories, well
      deserve to be studied. In general nothing is less attractive than an
      epitome: but the epitomes of Goldsmith, even when most concise, are always
      amusing; and to read them is considered by intelligent children, not as a
      task, but as a pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith might now be considered as a prosperous man. He had the means of
      living in comfort, and even in what to one who had so often slept in barns
      and on bulks must have been luxury. His fame was great and was constantly
      rising. He lived in what was intellectually far the best society of the
      kingdom, in a society in which no talent or accomplishment was wanting,
      and in which the art of conversation was cultivated with splendid success.
      There probably were never four talkers more admirable in four different
      ways than Johnson, Burke, Beauclerk, and Garrick; and Goldsmith was on
      terms of intimacy with all the four. He aspired to share in their
      colloquial renown; but never was ambition more unfortunate. It may seem
      strange that a man who wrote with so much perspicuity, vivacity, and
      grace, should have been, whenever he took a part in conversation, an
      empty, noisy, blundering rattle. But on this point the evidence is
      overwhelming. <span class="pagenum">166</span><a name="link166"
       id="link166"></a>So extraordinary was the contrast between Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      published works and the silly things which he said, that Horace Walpole
      described him as an inspired idiot. &ldquo;Noll,&rdquo; said Garrick, &ldquo;wrote like an
      angel, and talked like poor Pol.&rdquo; Charnier declared that it was a hard
      exercise of faith to believe that so foolish a chatterer could have really
      written the &ldquo;Traveller.&rdquo; Even Boswell could say, with contemptuous
      compassion, that he liked very well to hear honest Goldsmith run on. &ldquo;Yes,
      sir,&rdquo; said Johnson; &ldquo;but he should not like to hear himself.&rdquo; Minds differ
      as rivers differ. There are transparent and sparkling rivers from which it
      is delightful to drink as they flow; to such rivers the minds of such men
      as Burke and Johnson may be compared. But there are rivers of which the
      water when first drawn is turbid and noisome, but becomes pellucid as
      crystal, and delicious to the taste, if it be suffered to stand till it
      has deposited a sediment; and such a river is a type of the mind of
      Goldsmith. His first thoughts on every subject were confused even to
      absurdity; but they required only a little time to work themselves clear.
      When he wrote they had that time; and therefore his readers pronounced him
      a man of genius: but when he talked he talked nonsense, and made himself
      the laughing-stock of his hearers. He was painfully sensible of his
      inferiority in conversation; he felt every failure keenly: yet he had not
      sufficient judgment and self-command to hold his tongue. His animal
      spirits and vanity were always impelling him to try to do the one thing
      whieh he could not do. After every attempt he felt that he had exposed
      himself, and writhed with shame and vexation; yet the next moment he began
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His <span class="pagenum">167</span><a name="link167" id="link167"></a>associates
      seem to have regarded him with kindness, which, in spite of their
      admiration of his writings, was not unmixed with contempt. In truth, there
      was in Ins character much to love, but very little to respect. His heart
      was soft even to weakness: he was so generous that he quite forgot to be
      just; he forgave injuries so readily that he might be said to invite them;
      and was so liberal to beggars that he had nothing left for his tailor and
      his butcher. He was vain, sensual, frivolous, profuse, improvident. One
      vice of a darker shade was imputed to him, envy. But there is not the
      least reason to believe that this bad passion, though it sometimes made
      him wince and utter fretful exclamations, ever impelled him to injure by
      wicked arts the reputation of any of his rivals. The truth probably is,
      that he was not more envious, but merely less prudent, than his
      neighbours. His heart was on his lips. All those small jealousies, which
      are but too common among men of letters, but which a man of letters who is
      also a man of the world does his best to conceal, Goldsmith avowed with
      the simplicity of a child. When he was envious, instead of affecting
      indifference, instead of damning with faint praise, instead of
      doing-injuries slily and in the dark, he told every body that he was
      envious. &ldquo;Do not, pray, do not talk of Johnson in such terms,&rdquo; he said to
      Boswell; &ldquo;you harrow up my very soul.&rdquo; George Steevens and Cumberland were
      men far too cunning to say such a thing. They would have echoed the
      praises of the man whom they envied, and then have sent to the newspapers
      anonymous libels upon him. Both what was good and what was bad in
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s character was to his associates a perfect security that he
      would never commit such villany. He was neither ill-natured enough, nor
      longheaded <span class="pagenum">168</span><a name="link168" id="link168"></a>enough,
      to be guilty of any malicious act which required contrivance and disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith has sometimes been represented as a man of genius, cruelly
      treated by the world, and doomed to struggle with difficulties which at
      last broke his heart. But no representation can be more remote from the
      truth. He did, indeed, go through much sharp misery before he had done
      anything considerable in literature. But, after his name had appeared on
      the title-page of the &ldquo;Traveller,&rdquo; he had none but himself to blame for
      his distresses. His average income, during the last seven years of his
      life, certainly exceeded 400l. a year; and 400l. a year ranked, among the
      incomes of that day, at least as high as 800l. a year would rank at
      present. A single man living in the Temple with 400l. a year might then be
      called opulent. Not one in ten of the young gentlemen of good families who
      were studying the law there had so much. But all the wealth which Lord
      Clive had brought from Bengal, and Sir Lawrence Dundas from Germany,
      joined together, would not have sufficed for Goldsmith. He spent twice as
      much as he had. He wore fine clothes, gave dinners of several courses,
      paid court to venal beauties. He had also, it should be remembered, to the
      honour of his heart, though not of his head, a guinea, or five, or ten,
      according to the state of his purse, ready for any tale of distress, true
      or false. But it was not in dress or feasting, in promiscuous amours or
      promiscuous charities, that his chief expense lay. He had been from
      boyhood a gambler, and at once the most sanguine and the most unskilful of
      gamblers. For a time he put off the day of inevitable ruin by temporary
      expedients. He obtained advances from booksellers, by promising to execute
      works <span class="pagenum">169</span><a name="link169" id="link169"></a>which
      he never began. But at length this source of supply failed. He owed more
      than 2000l. and he saw no hope of extrication from his embarrassments. His
      spirits and health gave way. He was attacked by a nervous fever, which he
      thought himself competent to treat, It would have been happy for him if
      his medical skill had been appreciated as justly by himself as by others.
      Notwithstanding the degree which he pretended to have received at Padua,
      he could procure no patients. &ldquo;I do not practise,&rdquo; he once said; &ldquo;I make
      it a rule to prescribe only for my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, dear Doctor,&rdquo; said Beauclerk, &ldquo;alter your rule; and prescribe only
      for your enemies.&rdquo; Goldsmith now, in spite of this excellent advice,
      prescribed for himself. The remedy aggravated the malady. The sick man was
      induced to call in real physicians; and they at one time imagined that
      they had cured the disease. Still his weakness and restlessness continued.
      He could get no sleep. He could take no food. &ldquo;You are worse,&rdquo; said one of
      his medical attendants, &ldquo;than you should be from the degree of fever which
      you have. Is your mind at ease?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it is not,&rdquo; were the last recorded
      words of Oliver Goldsmith. He died on the third of April 1774, in his
      forty-sixth year. He was laid in the churchyard of the Temple; but the
      spot was not marked by any inscription, and is now forgotten. The coffin
      was followed by Burke and Reynolds. Both these great men were sincere
      mourners. Burke, when he heard of Goldsmith&rsquo;s death, had burst into a
      flood of tears. Reynolds had been so much moved by the news that he had
      flung aside his brush and palette for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after Goldsmith&rsquo;s death, a little poem appeared, <span
      class="pagenum">170</span><a name="link170" id="link170"></a>which will,
      as long as our language lasts, associate the names of his two illustrious
      friends with his own. It has already been mentioned that he sometimes felt
      keenly the sarcasm which his wild blundering talk brought upon him. He
      was, not long before his last illness, provoked into retaliating. He
      wisely betook himself to his pen; and at that weapon he proved himself a
      match for all his assailants together. Within a small compass he drew with
      a singularly easy and vigorous pencil the characters of nine or ten of his
      intimate associates. Though this little work did not receive his last
      touches, it must always be regarded as a masterpiece. It is impossible,
      however, not to wish that four or five likenesses which have no interest
      for posterity were wanting to that noble gallery, and that their places
      were supplied by sketches of Johnson and Gibbon, as happy and vivid as the
      sketches of Burke and Garrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Goldsmith&rsquo;s friends and admirers honoured him with a cenotaph in
      Westminster Abbey. Nollekens was the sculptor; and Johnson wrote the
      inscription. It is much to be lamented that Johnson did not leave to
      posterity a more durable and a more valuable memorial of his friend. A
      life of Goldsmith would have been an inestimable addition to the Lives of
      the Poets. No man appreciated Goldsmith&rsquo;s writings more justly than
      Johnson: no man was better acquainted with Goldsmith&rsquo;s character and
      habits; and no man was more competent to delineate with truth and spirit
      the peculiarities of a mind in which great powers were found in company
      with great weaknesses. But the list of poets to whose works Johnson was
      requested by the booksellers to furnish prefaces ended with Lyttleton, who
      died in 1773. The line seems to have <span class="pagenum">171</span><a
      name="link171" id="link171"></a>been drawn expressly for the purpose of
      excluding the person whose portrait would have most fitly closed the
      series. Goldsmith, however, has been fortunate in his biographers. Within
      a few years his life has been written by Mr. Prior, by Mr. Washington
      Irving, and by Mr. Forster. The diligence of Mr. Prior deserves great
      praise: the style of Mr. Washington Irving is always pleasing; but the
      highest place must, in justice, be assigned to the eminently interesting
      work of Mr. Forster.

    <h2>
      SAMUEL JOHNSON.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Encyclopodia Britannica</i>, December 1856.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>amuel Johnson,
      <span class="pagenum">172</span><a name="link172" id="link172"></a>one of
      the most eminent English writers of the eighteenth century, was the son of
      Michael Johnson, who was, at the beginning of that century, a magistrate
      of Lichfield, and a bookseller of great note in the midland counties.
      Michael&rsquo;s abilities and attainments seem to have been considerable. He was
      so well acquainted with the contents of the volumes which he exposed to
      sale, that the country rectors of Staffordshire and Worcestershire thought
      him an oracle on points of learning. Between him and the clergy, indeed,
      there was a strong religious and political sympathy. He was a zealous
      churchman, and, though he had qualified himself for municipal office by
      taking the oaths to the sovereigns in possession, was to the last a
      Jacobite in heart. At his house, a house which is still pointed out to
      every traveller who visits Lichfield, Samuel was born on the 18th of
      September 1709. In the child, the physical, intellectual, and moral
      peculiarities which afterwards distinguished the man were plainly
      discernible; great muscular strength accompanied by much awkwardness and
      many infirmities; great quickness of parts, with a morbid propensity to
      sloth and procrastination; a kind and generous heart, <span class="pagenum">173</span><a
      name="link173" id="link173"></a>with a gloomy and irritable temper. He had
      inherited from his ancestors a scrofulous taint, which it was beyond the
      power of medicine to remove. His parents were weak enough to believe that
      the royal touch was a specific for this malady. In his third year he was
      taken up to London, inspected by the court surgeon, prayed over by the
      court chaplains, and stroked and presented with a piece of gold by Queen
      Anne. One of his earliest recollections was that of a stately lady in a
      diamond stomacher and a long black hood. Her hand was applied in vain. The
      boy&rsquo;s features, which were originally noble and not irregular, were
      distorted by his malady. His cheeks were deeply scarred. He lost for a
      time the sight of one eye; and he saw but very imperfectly with the other.
      But the force of his mind overcame every impediment. Indolent as he was,
      he acquired knowledge with such ease and rapidity that at every school to
      which he was sent he was soon the best scholar. From sixteen to eighteen
      he resided at home, and was left to his own devices. He learned much at
      this time, though his studies were without guidance and without plan. He
      ransacked his father&rsquo;s shelves, dipped into a multitude of books, read
      what was interesting, and passed over what was dull. An ordinary lad would
      have acquired little or no useful knowledge in such a way: but much that
      was dull to ordinary lads was interesting to Samuel. He read little Greek;
      for his proficiency in that language was not such that he could take much
      pleasure in the masters of Attic poetry and eloquence. But he had left
      school a good Latinist; and he soon acquired, in the large and
      miscellaneous library of which he now had the command, an extensive
      knowledge of Latin literature. <span class="pagenum">174</span><a
      name="link174" id="link174"></a>That Augustan delicacy of taste which is
      the boast of the great public schools of England he never possessed. But
      he was early familiar with some classical writers who were quite unknown
      to the best scholars in the sixth form at Eton. He was peculiarly
      attracted by the works of the great restorers of learning. Once, while
      searching for some apples, he found a large folio volume of Petrarch&rsquo;s
      works. The name excited his curiosity; and he eagerly devoured hundreds of
      pages. Indeed, the diction and versification of his own Latin compositions
      show that he had paid at least as much attention to modern copies from the
      antique as to the original models.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thus irregularly educating himself, his family was sinking
      into hopeless poverty. Old Michael Johnson was much better qualified to
      pore upon books, and to talk about them, than to trade in them. His
      business declined; his debts increased; it was with difficulty that the
      daily expenses of his household were defrayed. It was out of his power to
      support his son at either university: but a wealthy neighbour offered
      assistance; and, in reliance on promises which proved to be of very little
      value, Samuel was entered at Pembroke College, Oxford. When the young
      scholar presented himself to the rulers of that society, they were amazed
      not more by his ungainly figure and eccentric manners than by the quantity
      of extensive and curious information which he had picked up during many
      months of desultory but not unprofitable study. On the first day of his
      residence he surprised his teachers by quoting Macrobius; and one of the
      most learned among them declared that he had never known a freshman of
      equal attainments.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Oxford, Johnson resided during about three years. <span class="pagenum">175</span><a
      name="link175" id="link175"></a>He was poor, even to raggedness; and his
      appearance excited a mirth and a pity winch were equally intolerable to
      his haughty spirit. He was driven from the quadrangle of Christ Church by
      the sneering looks which the members of that aristocratical society cast
      at the holes in his shoes. Some charitable person placed a new pair at his
      door; but he spurned them away in a fury. Distress made him, not servile,
      but reckless and ungovernable. No opulent gentleman commoner, panting for
      one-and-twenty, could have treated the academical authorities with more
      gross disrespect. The needy scholar was generally to be seen under the
      gate of Pembroke, a gate now adorned with his effigy, haranguing a circle
      of lads, over whom, in spite of his tattered gown and dirty linen, his wit
      and audacity gave him an undisputed ascendency. In every mutiny against
      the discipline of the college he was the ringleader. Much was pardoned,
      however, to a youth so highly distinguished by abilities and acquirements.
      He had early made himself known by turning Pope&rsquo;s Messiah into Latin
      verse. The style and rhythm, indeed, were not exactly Virgilian; but the
      translation found many admirers, and was read with pleasure by Pope
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time drew near at which Johnson would, in the ordinary course of
      things, have become a Bachelor of Arts: but he was at the end of his
      resources. Those promises of support on which he had relied had not been
      kept. His family could do nothing for him. His debts to Oxford tradesmen
      were small indeed, yet larger than he could pay. In the autumn of 1731, he
      was under the necessity of quitting the university without a degree. In
      the following winter his father died. The old man left but a pittance; and
      of that thought grounds sufficient for absolving felons, and for setting
      aside wills. His grimaces, his gestures, his mutterings, sometimes
      diverted and sometimes terrified people who did not know him. At a dinner
      table he would, in a fit of absence, stoop down and twitch off a lady&rsquo;s
      shoe. He would amaze a drawing room by suddenly ejaculating a clause of
      the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would conceive an unintelligible aversion to a particular alley, and
      perform a great circuit rather than see the hateful place. He would set
      his heart on touching every post in the streets through which he walked.
      If by any chance he missed a post, he would go back a hundred yards and
      repair the omission. Under the influence of his disease, his senses became
      morbidly torpid, and his imagination morbidly active.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time he would stand poring on the town clock without being able to
      tell the hour. At another, he would distinctly hear his mother, who was
      many miles off, calling him by his name. But this was not the worst. A
      deep melancholy took possession of him, and gave a dark tinge to all his
      views of human napittance <span class="pagenum">176</span><a name="link176"
       id="link176"></a>almost the whole was appropriated to the support of his
      widow. The property to which Samuel succeeded amounted to no more than
      twenty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life, during the thirty years which followed, was one hard struggle
      with poverty. The misery of that struggle needed no aggravation, but was
      aggravated by the sufferings of an unsound body and an unsound mind.
      Before the young man left the university, his hereditary malady had broken
      forth in a singularly cruel form. He had become an incurable
      hypochondriac. He said long after that he had been mad all his life, or at
      least not perfectly sane; and, in truth, eccentricities less strange than
      his have often been ture <span class="pagenum">177</span><a name="link177"
       id="link177"></a>and of human destiny. Such wretchedness as he endured has
      driven many men to shoot themselves or drown themselves. But he was under
      no temptation to commit suicide. He was sick of life; but he was afraid of
      death; and he shuddered at every sight or sound which reminded him of the
      inevitable hour. In religion he found but little comfort during his long
      and frequent fits of dejection; for his religion partook of his own
      character. The light from heaven shone on him indeed, but not in a direct
      line, or with its own pure splendour. The rays had to struggle through a
      disturbing medium; they reached him refracted, dulled and discoloured by
      the thick gloom which had settled on his soul; and, though they might be
      sufficiently clear to guide him, were too dim to cheer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such infirmities of body and of mind, this celebrated man was left,
      at two-and-twenty, to fight his way through the world. He remained during
      about five years in the midland counties. At Lichfield, his birth-place
      and his early home, he had inherited some friends and acquired others. He
      was kindly noticed by Henry Hervey, a gay officer of noble family, who
      happened to be quartered there. Gilbert Walmesley, registrar of the
      ecclesiastical court of the diocese, a man of distinguished parts,
      learning, and knowledge of the world, did himself honour by patronising
      the young adventurer, whose repulsive person, unpolished manners and
      squalid garb moved many of the petty aristocracy of the neighbourhood to
      laughter or to disgust. At Lichfield, however, Johnson could find no way
      of earning a livelihood. He became usher of a grammar school in
      Leicestershire; he resided as a humble companion in the house of a country
      gentleman; but a life of dependence was insupportable to his haughty
      spirit. He repaired <span class="pagenum">178</span><a name="link178"
       id="link178"></a>to Birmingham, and there earned a few guineas by literary
      drudgery. In that town he printed a translation, little noticed at the
      time, and long forgotten, of a Latin book about Abyssinia. He then put
      forth proposals for publishing by subscription the poems of Politian, with
      notes containing a history of modern Latin verse: but subscriptions did
      not come in; and the volume never appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      While leading this vagrant and miserable life, Johnson fell in love. The
      object of his passion was Mrs. Elizabeth Porter, a widow who had children
      as old as himself. To ordinary spectators, the lady appeared to be a
      short, fat, coarse woman, painted half an inch thick, dressed in gaudy
      colours, and fond of exhibiting provincial airs and graces which were not
      exactly those of the Queensberrys and Lepels. To Johnson, however, whose
      passions were strong, whose eyesight was too weak to distinguish ceruse
      from natural bloom, and who had seldom or never been in the same room with
      a woman of real fashion, his Titty, as he called her, was the most
      beautiful, graceful and accomplished of her sex. That his admiration was
      unfeigned cannot be doubted; for she was as poor as himself. She accepted,
      with a readiness which did her little honour, the addresses of a suitor
      who might have been her son. The marriage, however, in spite of occasional
      wranglings, proved happier than might have been expected. The lover
      continued to be under the illusions of the wedding-day till the lady died
      in her sixty-fourth year. On her monument he placed an inscription
      extolling the charms of her person and of her manners; and, when, long
      after her decease, he had occasion to mention her, he exclaimed, with a
      tenderness half ludicrous, half pathetic, &ldquo;Pretty creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His <span class="pagenum">179</span><a name="link179" id="link179"></a>marriage
      made it necessary for him to exert himself more strenuously than he had
      hitherto done. He took a house in the neighbourhood of his native town,
      and advertised for pupils. But eighteen months passed away; and only three
      pupils came to his academy. Indeed, his appearance was so strange, and his
      temper so violent, that his schoolroom must have resembled an ogre&rsquo;s den.
      Nor was the tawdry painted grandmother whom he called his Titty well
      qualified to make provision for the comfort of young gentlemen. David
      Garrick, who was one of the pupils, used, many years later, to throw the
      best company of London into convulsions of laughter by mimicking the
      endearments of this extraordinary pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Johnson, in the twenty-eighth year of his age, determined to
      seek his fortune in the capital as a literary adventurer. He set out with
      a few guineas, three acts of the tragedy of Irene in manuscript, and two
      or three letters of introduction from his friend Walmesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never, since literature became a calling in England, had it been a less
      gainful calling than at the time when Johnson took up his residence in
      London. In the preceding generation a writer of eminent merit was sure to
      be munificently rewarded by the government. The least that he could expect
      was a pension or a sinecure place; and, if he showed any aptitude for
      politics, he might hope to be a member of parliament, a lord of the
      treasury, an ambassador, a secretary of state. It would be easy, on the
      other hand, to name several writers of the nineteenth century of whom the
      least successful has received forty thousand pounds from the booksellers.
      But Johnson entered on his vocation in the most dreary part of the dreary
      interval which <span class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180"
       id="link180"></a>separated two ages of prosperity. Literature had ceased
      to flourish under the patronage of the great, and had not begun to
      flourish under the patronage of the public. One man of letters, indeed.
      Pope, had acquired by his pen what was then considered as a handsome
      fortune, and lived on a footing of equality with nobles and ministers of
      state. But this was a solitary exception. Even an author whose reputation
      was established, and whose works were popular, such an author as Thomson,
      whose Seasons were in every library, such an author as Fielding, whose
      Pasquin had had a greater run than any drama since The Begar&rsquo;s Opera, was
      sometimes glad to obtain, by pawning his best coat, the means of dining on
      tripe at a cook-shop underground, where he could wipe his hands, after his
      greasy meal, on the back of a Newfoundland dog. It is easy, therefore, to
      imagine what humiliations and privations must have awaited the novice who
      had still to earn a name. One of the publishers to whom Johnson applied
      for employment measured with a scornful eye that athletic though uncouth
      frame, and exclaimed, &ldquo;You had better get a porter&rsquo;s knot, and carry
      trunks.&rdquo; Nor was the advice bad; for a porter was likely to be as
      plentifully fed, and as comfortably lodged, as a poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time appears to have elapsed before Johnson was able to form any
      literary connection from which he could expect more than bread for the day
      which was passing g over him. He never forgot the generosity with which
      Hervey, who was now residing in London, relieved his wants during this
      time of trial. &ldquo;Harry Hervey,&rdquo; said the old philosopher many years later,
      &ldquo;was a vicious man; but he was very kind to me. If you call a dog Hervey I
      shall love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At <span class="pagenum">181</span><a name="link181" id="link181"></a>Hervey&rsquo;s
      table Johnson sometimes enjoyed feasts which were made more agreeable by
      contrast. But in general be dined, and thought that he dined well, on
      sixpenny worth of meat, and a pennyworth of bread, at an alehouse near
      Drury Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the privations and sufferings which he endured at this time
      was discernible to the last in his temper and his deportment. His manners
      had never been courtly. They now became almost savage. Being frequently
      under the necessity of wearing shabby coats and dirty shirts, he became a
      confirmed sloven. Being often very hungry when he sat down to his meals,
      he contracted a habit of eating with ravenous greediness. Even to the end
      of his life, and even at the tables of the great, the sight of food
      affected him as it affects wild beasts and birds of prey. His taste in
      cookery, formed in subterranean ordinaries and ala mode beefshops, was far
      from delicate. Whenever he was so fortunate as to have near him a hare
      that had been kept too long, or a meat pie made with rancid butter, he
      gorged himself with such violence that his veins swelled, and the moisture
      broke out on his forehead. The affronts which his poverty emboldened
      stupid and low-minded men to offer to him would have broken a mean spirit
      into sycophancy, but made him rude even to ferocity. Unhappily the
      insolence which, while it was defensive, was pardonable, and in some sense
      respectable, accompanied him into societies where he was treated with
      courtesy and kindness. He was repeatedly provoked into striking those who
      had taken liberties with him. All the sufferers, however, were wise enough
      to abstain from talking about their beatings, except Osborne, the most
      rapacious and brutal of booksellers, who proclaimed every where that he
      had been <span class="pagenum">182</span><a name="link182" id="link182"></a>knocked
      down by the huge fellow whom he had hired to puff the Harleian Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      About, a year after Johnson had begun to reside in London, he was
      fortunate enough to obtain regular employment from Cave, an enterprising
      and intelligent bookseller, who was proprietor and editor of the
      &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine.&rdquo; That journal, just entering on the ninth year of
      its long existence, was the only periodical work in the kingdom which then
      had what would now be called a large circulation. It was, indeed, the
      chief source of parliamentary intelligence. It was not then safe, even
      during a recess, to publish an account of the proceedings of either House
      without some disguise. Cave, however, ventured to entertain his readers
      with what he called &ldquo;Reports of the Debates of the Senate of Lilliput.&rdquo;
       France was Blefuseu; London was Mildendo: pounds were sprugs: the Duke of
      Newcastle was the Nardac secretary of State: Lord Hardwicke was the Hurgo
      Hickrad: and William Pulteney was Wingul Pulnub. To write the speeches,
      was, during several years, the business of Johnson. He was generally
      furnished with notes, meagre indeed, and inaccurate, of what had been
      said; but sometimes he had to find arguments and eloquence both for the
      ministry and for the opposition. He was himself a Tory, not from rational
      conviction&mdash;for his serious opinion was that one form of government
      was just as good or as bad as another&mdash;but from mere passion, such as
      inflamed the Capulets against the Montagues, or the Blues of the Roman
      circus against the Greens. In his infancy he had heard so much talk about
      the villanies of the Whigs, and the dangers of the Church, that he had
      become a furious partisan when he could scarcely speak. Before he was
      three he <span class="pagenum">183</span><a name="link183" id="link183"></a>had
      insisted on being taken to hear Saeheverell preach at Lichfield Cathedral,
      and had listened to the sermon with as much respect, and probably with as
      much intelligence, as any Staffordshire squire in the congregation. The
      work which had been begun in the nursery had been completed by the
      university. Oxford, when Johnson resided there, was the most Jacobitical
      place in England; and Pembroke was one of the most Jacobitical colleges in
      Oxford. The prejudices which he brought up to London were scarcely less
      absurd than those of his own Tom Tempest. Charles II. and James II. were
      two of the best kings that ever reigned. Laud, a poor creature who never
      did, said, or wrote anything indicating more than the ordinary capacity of
      an old woman, was a prodigy of parts and learning over whose tomb Art and
      Genius still continued to weep. Hampden deserved no more honourable name
      than that of &ldquo;the zealot of rebellion.&rdquo; Even the ship money, condemned not
      less decidedly by Falkland and Clarendon than by the bitterest Roundheads,
      Johnson would not pronounce to have been an unconstitutional impost. Under
      a government, the mildest that had ever been known in the world&mdash;under
      a government which allowed to the people an unprecedented liberty of
      speech and action&mdash;he fancied that he was a slave; he assailed the
      ministry with obloquy which refuted itself, and regretted the lost freedom
      and happiness of those golden days in which a writer who had taken but
      one-tenth part of the license allowed to him would have been pilloried,
      mangled with the shears, whipped at the cart&rsquo;s tail, and flung into a
      noisome dungeon to die. He hated dissenters and stock-jobbers, the excise
      and the army, septennial parliaments, and continental connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      He <span class="pagenum">184</span><a name="link184" id="link184"></a>long
      had an aversion to the Scotch, an aversion of which he could not remember
      the commencement, but which, he owned, had probably originated in his
      abhorrence of the conduct of the nation during the Great Rebellion. It is
      easy to guess in what manner debates on great party questions were likely
      to be reported by a man whose judgment was so much disordered by party
      spirit, A show of fairness was indeed necessary to the prosperity of the
      Magazine. But Johnson long afterwards owned that, though he had saved
      appearances, he had taken care that the Whig dogs should not have the best
      of it; and, in fact, every passage which has lived, every passage which
      bears the marks of his higher faculties, is put into the mouth of some
      member of the opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after Johnson had entered on these obscure labours, he
      published a work which at once placed him high among the writers of his
      age. It is probable that what he had suffered during his first year in
      London had often reminded him of some parts of that noble poem in which
      Juvenal had described the misery and degradation of a needy man of
      letters, lodged among the pigeons&rsquo; nests in the tottering garrets which
      overhung the streets of Rome. Pope&rsquo;s admirable imitations of Horace&rsquo;s
      Satires and Epistles had recently appeared, were in every hand, and were
      by many readers thought superior to the originals. What Pope had done for
      Horace, Johnson aspired to do for Juvenal. The enterprise was bold, and
      yet judicious. For between Johnson and Juvenal there was much in common,
      much more certainly than between Pope and Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson&rsquo;s London appeared without his name in May 1738. He received only
      ten guineas for this stately <span class="pagenum">185</span><a
      name="link185" id="link185"></a>and vigorous poem: but the sale was rapid,
      and the success complete. A second edition was required within a week.
      Those small critics who are always desirous to lower established
      reputations ran about proclaiming that the anonymous satirist was superior
      to Pope in Pope&rsquo;s own peculiar department of literature. It ought to be
      remembered, to the honour of Pope, that he joined heartily in the applause
      with which the appearance of a rival genius was welcomed. He made
      inquiries about the author of London. Such a man, he said, could not long
      be concealed. The name was soon discovered; and Pope, with great kindness,
      exerted himself to obtain an academical degree and the mastership of a
      grammar school for the poor young poet. The attempt failed; and Johnson
      remained a bookseller&rsquo;s hack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not appear that these two men, the most eminent writer of the
      generation which was going out, and the most eminent writer of the
      generation which was coming in, ever saw each other. They lived in very
      different circles, one surrounded by dukes and earls, the other by
      starving pamphleteers and index-makers. Among Johnson&rsquo;s associates at this
      time may be mentioned Boyse, who, when his shirts were pledged, scrawled
      Latin verses sitting up in bed with his arms through two holes in his
      blanket; who composed very respectable sacred poetry when he was sober;
      and who was at last run over by a hackney coach when he was drunk: Hoole,
      surnamed the metaphysical tailor, who, instead of attending to his
      measures, used to trace geometrical diagrams on the board where he sate
      cross-legged: and the penitent impostor, George Psalmanazar, who, after
      poring all day, in a humble lodging, on the folios of Jewish rabbis <span
      class="pagenum">186</span><a name="link186" id="link186"></a>and Christian
      fathers, indulged himself at night with literary and theological
      conversation at an alehouse in the city. But the most remarkable of the
      persons with whom at this time Johnson consorted was Richard Savage, an
      earl&rsquo;s son, a shoemaker&rsquo;s apprentice, who had seen life in all its forms,
      who had feasted among blue ribands in Saint James&rsquo;s Square, and had lain
      with fifty pounds&rsquo; weight of irons on his legs in the condemned ward of
      Newgate. This man had, after many vicissitudes of fortune, sunk at last
      into abject and hopeless poverty. His pen had failed him. His patrons had
      been taken away by death, or estranged by the riotous profusion with which
      he squandered their bounty, and the ungrateful insolence with which he
      rejected their advice. He now lived by begging. He dined on venison and
      champagne whenever he had been so fortunate as to borrow a guinea. If his
      questing had been unsuccessful, he appeased the rage of hunger with some
      scraps of broken meat, and lay down to rest under the Piazza of Covent
      Garden in warm weather, and, in cold weather, as near as he could get to
      the furnace of a glass house. Yet, in his misery, he was still an
      agreeable companion. He had an inexhaustible store of anecdotes about that
      gay and brilliant world from which he was now an outcast. He had observed
      the great men of both parties in hours of careless relaxation, had seen
      the leaders of opposition without the mask of patriotism, and had heard
      the prime minister roar with laughter and tell stories not over decent.
      During some months Savage lived in the closest familiarity with Johnson;
      and then the friends parted, not without tears. Johnson remained in London
      to drudge for Cave. Savage went to the West of England, <span
      class="pagenum">187</span><a name="link187" id="link187"></a>lived there
      as he had lived everywhere, and, in 1748, died, penniless and
      heart-broken, in Bristol gaol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after his death, while the public curiosity was strongly excited
      about his extraordinary character, and his not less extraordinary
      adventures, a life of him appeared widely different from the catchpenny
      lives of eminent men which were then a staple article of manufacture in
      Grub Street. The style was indeed deficient in ease and variety; and the
      writer was evidently too partial to the Latin element of our language. But
      the little work, with all its faults, was a masterpiece. No finer specimen
      of literary biography existed in any language, living or dead; and a
      discerning critic might have confidently predicted that the author was
      destined to be the founder of a new school of English eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Life of Savage was anonymous; but it was well known in literary
      circles that Johnson was the writer. During the three years which
      followed, he produced no important work; but he was not, and indeed could
      not be, idle. The fame of his abilities and learning continued to grow.
      Warburton pronounced him a man of parts and genius; and the praise of
      Warburton was then no light thing. Such was Johnson&rsquo;s reputation that, in
      1747, several eminent booksellers combined to employ him in the arduous
      work of preparing a Dictionary of the English Language, in two folio
      volumes. The sum which they agreed to pay him was only fifteen hundred
      guineas; and out of this sum he had to pay several poor men of letters who
      assisted him in the humbler parts of his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospectus of the Dictionary he addressed to the Earl of Chesterfield.
      Chesterfield had long been celebrated <span class="pagenum">188</span><a
      name="link188" id="link188"></a>for the politeness of his manners, the
      brilliancy of his wit, and the delicacy of his taste. He was acknowledged
      to be the finest speaker in the House of Lords. He had recently governed
      Ireland, at a momentous conjuncture, with eminent firmness, wisdom, and
      humanity; and he had since became Secretary of State. He received
      Johnson&rsquo;s homage with the most winning affability, and requited it with a
      few guineas, bestowed doubtless in a very graceful manner, but was by no
      means desirous to see all his carpets blackened with the London mud, and
      his soups and wines thrown to right and left over the gowns of fine ladies
      and the waistcoats of fine gentlemen, by an absent, awkward scholar, who
      gave strange starts and uttered strange growls, who dressed like a
      scarecrow, and ate like a cormorant. During some time Johnson continued to
      call on his patron, but, after being repeatedly told by the porter that
      his lordship was not at home, took the hint, and ceased to present himself
      at the inhospitable door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson had flattered himself that he should have completed his Dictionary
      by the end of 1750; but it was not till 1755 that he at length gave his
      huge vol-nines to the world. During the seven years which he passed in the
      drudgery of penning definitions and marking quotations for transcription,
      he sought for relaxation in literary labour of a more agreeable kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1749 he published the Vanity of Human Wishes, an excellent imitation of
      the Tenth Satire of Juvenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in truth not easy to say whether the palm belongs to the ancient or
      to the modern poet. The couplets in which the fall of Wolsey is described,
      though lofty and sonorous, are feeble when compared with the wonderful
      lines which bring before us all Rome in tumult on the day <span
      class="pagenum">189</span><a name="link189" id="link189"></a>of the fall
      of Sejanus, the laurels on the doorposts, the white bull stalking towards
      the Capitol, the statues rolling down from their pedestals, the flatterers
      of the disgraced minister running to see him dragged with a hook through
      the streets, and to have a kick at his carcase before it is hurled into
      the Tiber. It must be owned too that in the concluding passage the
      Christian moralist has not made the most of his advantages, and has fallen
      decidedly short of the sublimity of his Pagan model. On the other hand,
      Juvenal&rsquo;s Hannibal must yield to Johnson&rsquo;s Charles: and Johnson&rsquo;s vigorous
      and pathetic enumeration of the miseries of a literary life must be
      allowed to be superior to Juvenal&rsquo;s lamentation over the fate of
      Demosthenes and Cicero.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the copyright of the Vanity of Human Wishes Johnson received only
      fifteen guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after the publication of this poem, his tragedy, begun many
      years before, was brought on the stage. His pupil, David Garrick, had, in
      1741, made his appearance on a humble stage in Goodman&rsquo;s Fields, had at
      once risen to the first place among actors, and was now, after several
      years of almost uninterrupted success, manager of Drury Lane Theatre. The
      relation between him and his old preceptor was of a very singular kind.
      They repelled each other strongly, and yet attracted each other strongly.
      Nature had made them of very different clay; and circumstances had fully
      brought out the natural peculiarities of both. Sudden prosperity had
      turned Garrick&rsquo;s head. Continued adversity had soured Johnson&rsquo;s temper.
      Johnson saw with more envy than became so great a man the villa, the
      plate, the china, the Brussels carpet, which the little mimic had got by
      repeating, with grimaces and gesticulations, what wiser men had written;
      and the <span class="pagenum">190</span><a name="link190" id="link190"></a>exquisitely
      sensitive vanity of Garrick was galled by the thought that, while all the
      rest of the world was applauding him, he could obtain from one morose
      cynic, whose opinion it was impossible to despise, scarcely any compliment
      not acidulated with scorn. Yet the two Lichfield men had so many early
      recollections in common, and sympathised with each other on so many points
      on which they sympathised with nobody else in the vast population of the
      capital, that, though the master was often provoked by the monkey-like
      impertinence of the pupil, and the pupil by the bearish rudeness of the
      master, they remained friends till they were parted by death. Garrick now
      brought Irene out, with alterations sufficient to displease the author,
      yet not sufficient to make the piece pleasing to the audience. The public,
      however, listened with little emotion, but with much civility, to five
      acts of monotonous declamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After nine representations the play was withdrawn. It is, indeed,
      altogether unsuited to the stage, and, even when perused in the closet,
      will be found hardly worthy of the author. He had not the slightest notion
      of what blank verse should be. A change in the last syllable of every
      other line would make the versification of the Vanity of Human Wishes
      closely resemble the versification of Irene. The poet, however, cleared,
      by his benefit nights, and by the sale of the copyright of his tragedy,
      about three hundred pounds, then a great sum in his estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a year after the representation of Irene, he began to publish a
      series of short essays on morals, manners, and literature. This species of
      composition had been brought into fashion by the success of the Tatler,
      and by the still more brilliant success of the Spectator. A crowd of small
      writers had vainly attempted <span class="pagenum">191</span><a
      name="link191" id="link191"></a>to rival Addison. The Lay Monastery, the
      Censor, the Freethinker, the Plain Dealer, the Champion, and other works
      of the same kind, had had their short day. None of them had obtained a
      permanent place in our literature; and they are now to be found only in
      the libraries of the curious. At length Johnson undertook the adventure in
      which so many aspirants had failed. In the thirty-sixth year after the
      appearance of the last number of the Spectator appeared the first number
      of the Rambler. From March 1750 to March 1752, this paper continued to
      come out every Tuesday and Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first the Rambler was enthusiastically admired by a few eminent
      men. Richardson, when only five numbers had appeared, pronounced it equal,
      if not superior, to the Spectator. Young and Hartley expressed their
      approbation not less warmly. Bubb Dodington, among whose many faults
      indifference to the claims of genius and learning cannot be reckoned,
      solicited the acquaintance of the writer. In consequence probably of the
      good offices of Dodington, who was then the confidential adviser of Prince
      Frederic, two of his Royal Highness&rsquo;s gentlemen carried a gracious message
      to the printing office, and ordered seven copies for Leicester House. But
      these overtures seem to have been very coldly received. Johnson had had
      enough of the patronage of the great to last him all his life, and was not
      disposed to haunt any other door as he had haunted the door of
      Chesterfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the public the Rambler was at first very coldly received. Though the
      price of a number was only twopence, the sale did not amount to five
      hundred. The profits were therefore very small. But as soon as the flying
      leaves were collected and reprinted they became <span class="pagenum">192</span><a
      name="link192" id="link192"></a>popular. The author lived to see thirteen
      thousand copies spread over England alone. Separate editions were
      published for the Scotch and Irish markets. A large party pronounced the
      style perfect, so absolutely perfect that in some essays it would be
      impossible for the writer himself to alter a single word for the better.
      Another party, not less numerous, vehemently accused him of having
      corrupted the purity of the English tongue. The best critics admitted that
      his diction was too monotonous, too obviously artificial, and now and then
      turgid even to absurdity. But they did justice to the acuteness of his
      observations on morals and manners, to the constant precision and frequent
      brilliancy of his language, to the weighty and magnificent eloquence of
      many serious passages, and to the solemn yet pleasing humour of some of
      the lighter papers. On the question of precedence between Addison and
      Johnson, a question which, seventy years ago, was much disputed, posterity
      has pronounced a decision from which there is no appeal. Sir Roger, his
      chaplain and his butler, Will Wimble and Will Honeycomb, the Vision of
      Mirza, the Journal of the Retired Citizen, the Everlasting Club, the
      Dunmow Flitch, the Loves of Hilpah and Slialum, the Visit to the Exchange,
      and the Visit to the Abbey, are known to everybody. But many men and
      women, even of highly cultivated minds, are unacquainted with Squire
      Bluster and Mrs. Busy, Quisquilius and Venustulus, the Allegory of Wit and
      Learning, the Chronicle of the Revolutions of a Garret, and the sad fate
      of Aningait and Ajut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last Rambler was written in a sad and gloomy hour. Mrs. Johnson had
      been given over by the physicians. Three days later she died. She left her
      husband <span class="pagenum">193</span><a name="link193" id="link193"></a>almost
      broken-hearted. Many people had been surprised to see a man of his genius
      and learning stooping to every drudgery, and denying himself almost every
      comfort, for the purpose of supplying a silly, affected old woman with
      superfluities, which she accepted with but little gratitude. But all his
      affection had been concentrated on her. He had neither brother nor sister,
      neither son nor daughter. To him she was beautiful as the Gunnings, and
      witty as Lady Mary. Her opinion of his writings was more important to him
      than the voice of the pit of Drury Lane Theatre or the judgment of the
      Monthly Review. The chief support which had sustained him through the most
      arduous labour of his life was the hope that she would enjoy the fame and
      the profit which he anticipated from his Dictionary. She was gone; and in
      that vast labyrinth of streets, peopled by eight hundred thousand human
      beings, he was alone. Yet it was necessary for him to set himself, as he
      expressed it, doggedly to work. After three more laborious years, the
      Dictionary was at length complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been generally supposed that this great work would be dedicated to
      the eloquent and accomplished nobleman to whom the prospectus had been
      addressed. He well knew the value of such a compliment; and therefore,
      when the day of publication drew near, he exerted himself to soothe, by a
      show of zealous and at the same time of delicate and judicious kindness,
      the pride which he had so cruelly wounded. Since the Ramblers had ceased
      to appear, the town had been entertained by a journal called The World, to
      which many men of high rank and fashion contributed. In two successive
      numbers of The World the Dictionary was, to use the modern phrase, puffed
      with <span class="pagenum">194</span><a name="link194" id="link194"></a>wonderful
      skill. The writings of Johnson were warmly praised. It was proposed that
      he should be invested with the authority of a Dictator, nay, of a Pope,
      over our language, and that his decisions about the meaning and the
      spelling of words should be received as final. His two folios, it was
      said, would of course be bought by everybody who could afford to buy them.
      It was soon known that these papers were written by Chesterfield. But the
      just resentment of Johnson was not to be so appeased. In a letter written
      with singular energy and dignity of thought and language, he repelled the
      tardy advances of his patron. The Dictionary came forth without a
      dedication. In the preface the author truly declared that he owed nothing
      to the great, and described the difficulties with which he had been left
      to struggle so forcibly and pathetically that the ablest and most
      malevolent of all the enemies of his fame, Horne Tooke, never could read
      that passage without tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public, on this occasion, did Johnson full justice, and something more
      than justice. The best lexicographer may well be content if his
      productions are received by the world with cold esteem. But Johnson&rsquo;s
      Dictionary was hailed with an enthusiasm such as no similar work has ever
      excited. It was indeed the first dictionary which could be read with
      pleasure. The definitions show so much acuteness of thought and command of
      language, and the passages quoted from poets, divines and philosophers are
      so skilfully selected, that a leisure hour may always be very agreeably
      spent in turning over the pages. The faults of the book resolve
      themselves, for the most part, into one great fault. Johnson was a
      wretched etymologist. He knew little or nothing of any Teutonic language
      <span class="pagenum">195</span><a name="link195" id="link195"></a>except
      English, which indeed, as he wrote it, was scarcely a Teutonic language;
      and thus he was absolutely at the mercy of Junius and Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dictionary, though it raised Johnson&rsquo;s fame, added nothing to his
      pecuniary means. The fifteen hundred guineas which the booksellers had
      agreed to pay him had been advanced and spent before the last sheets
      issued from the press. It is painful to relate that, twice in the course
      of the year which followed the publication of this great work, he was
      arrested and carried to spunging-houses, and that he was twice indebted
      for his liberty to his excellent friend Richardson. It was still necessary
      for the man who had been formally saluted by the highest authority as
      Dictator of the English language to supply his wants by constant toil. He
      abridged his Dictionary. He proposed to bring out an edition of Shakspeare
      by subscription; and many subscribers sent in their names, and laid down
      their money; but he soon found the task so little to his taste that he
      turned to more attractive employments. He contributed many papers to a new
      monthly journal, which was called the Literary Magazine. Few of these
      papers have much interest; but among them was the very best thing that he
      ever wrote, a masterpiece both of reasoning and of satirical pleasantry,
      the review of Jenyns&rsquo;s Inquiry into The Nature and Origin of Evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1758 Johnson put forth the first of a series of essays,
      entitled The Idler. During two years these essays continued to appear
      weekly. They were eagerly read, widely circulated, and, indeed, impudently
      pirated, while they were still in the original form, and had a large sale
      when collected into volumes. The Idler may be described as a second part
      of The <span class="pagenum">196</span><a name="link196" id="link196"></a>Rambler,
      somewhat livelier and somewhat weaker than the first part.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Johnson was busied with his Idlers, his mother, who had accomplished
      her ninetieth year, died at Lichfield. It was long since he had seen her;
      but he had not failed to contribute largely, out of his small means, to
      her comfort. In order to defray the charges of her funeral, and to pay
      some debts which she had left, he wrote a little book in a single week,
      and sent off the sheets to the press without reading them over. A hundred
      pounds were paid him for the copyright; and the purchasers had great cause
      to be pleased with their bargain; for the book was Rasselas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of Rasselas was great, though such ladies as Miss Lydia
      Languish must have been grievously disappointed when they found that the
      new volume from the circulating library was little more than a
      dissertation on the author&rsquo;s favourite theme, the Vanity of Human Wishes;
      that the Prince of Abyssinia was without a mistress, and the Princess
      without a lover; and that the story set the hero and the heroine down
      exactly where it had taken them up. The style was the subject of much
      eager controversy. The Monthly Review and the Critical Review took
      different sides. Many readers pronounced tire writer a pompous pedant, who
      would never use a word of two syllables where it was possible to use a
      word of six, and who could not make a waiting woman relate her adventures
      without balancing every noun with another noun, and every epithet with
      another epithet. Another party, not less zealous, cited with delight
      numerous passages in which weighty meaning was expressed with accuracy and
      illustrated with splendour. And both the censure and the praise were
      merited.
    </p>
    <p>
      About <span class="pagenum">197</span><a name="link197" id="link197"></a>the
      plan of Rasselas little was said by the critics; and yet the faults of the
      plan might seem to invite severe criticism. Johnson has frequently blamed
      Shakspeare for neglecting the proprieties of time and place, and for
      ascribing to one age or nation the manners and opinions of another. Yet
      Shakspeare has not sinned in this way more grievously than Johnson.
      Rasselas and Imlac, Nekayah and Pekuah, are evidently meant to be
      Abyssinians of the eighteenth century: for the Europe which Imlac
      describes is the Europe of the eighteenth century; and the inmates of the
      Happy Valley talk familiarly of that law of gravitation which Newton
      discovered, and which was not fully received even at Cambridge till the
      eighteenth century. What a real company of Abyssinians would have been may
      be learned from Bruce&rsquo;s Travels. But Johnson, not content with turning
      filthy savages, ignorant of their letters, and gorged with raw steaks cut
      from living cows, into philosophers as eloquent and enlightened as himself
      or his friend Burke, and into ladies as highly accomplished as Mrs. Lennox
      or Mrs. Sheridan, transferred the whole domestic system of England to
      Egypt. Into a land of harems, a land of polygamy, a land where women are
      married without ever being seen, he introduced the flirtations and
      jealousies of our ball-rooms. In a land where there is boundless liberty
      of divorce, wedlock is described as the indissoluble compact. &ldquo;A youth and
      maiden meeting by chance, or brought together by artifice, exchange
      glances, reciprocate civilities, go home, and dream of each other. Such,&rdquo;
       says Rasselas, &ldquo;is the common process of marriage.&rdquo; Such it may have been,
      and may still be, in London, but assuredly not at Cairo. A writer who was
      guilty of such improprieties had <span class="pagenum">198</span><a
      name="link198" id="link198"></a>little right to blame the poet who made
      Hector quote Aristotle, and represented Julio Romano as flourishing in the
      days of the oracle of Delphi.
    </p>
    <p>
      By such exertions as have been described, Johnson supported himself till
      the year 1702. In that year a great change in his circumstances took
      place. He had from a child been an enemy of the reigning dynasty. His
      Jacobite prejudices had been exhibited with little disguise both in his
      works and in his conversation. Even in his massy and elaborate Dictionary,
      he had, with a strange want of taste and judgment, inserted bitter and
      contumelious reflections on the Whig party. The excise, which was a
      favourite resource of Whig financiers, he had designated as a hateful tax.
      He had railed against the commissioners of excise in language so coarse
      that they had seriously thought of prosecuting him. He had with difficulty
      been prevented from holding up the Lord Privy Seal by name as an example
      of the meaning of the word &ldquo;renegade.&rdquo;&rsquo; A pension he had defined as pay
      given to a state hireling to betray his country; a pensioner as a slave of
      state hired by a stipend to obey a master. It seemed un-likely that the
      author of these definitions would himself be pensioned. But that was a
      time of wonders. George the Third had ascended the throne; and had, in the
      course of a few months, disgusted many of the old friends and conciliated
      many of the old enemies of his house. The city was becoming mutinous.
      Oxford was becoming loyal. Cavendishes and Bentincks were murmuring.
      Somersets and Wyndhams were hastening to kiss hands. The head of the
      treasury was now Lord Bute, who was a Tory, and could have no objection to
      Johnson&rsquo;s Toryism. Bute wished to be thought a patron of men of letters;
      and Johnson was one of the <span class="pagenum">199</span><a
      name="link199" id="link199"></a>most eminent and one of the most needy men
      of letters in Europe. A pension of three hundred a year was graciously
      offered, and with very little hesitation accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This event produced a change in Johnson&rsquo;s whole way of life. For the first
      time since his boyhood he no longer felt the daily goad urging him to the
      daily toil. He was at liberty, after thirty years of anxiety and drudgery,
      to indulge his constitutional indolence, to be in bed till two in the
      afternoon, and to sit up talking till four in the morning, without fearing
      either the printer&rsquo;s devil or the sheriff&rsquo;s officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      One laborious task indeed he had bound himself to perform. He had received
      large subscriptions for his promised edition of Shakspeare; he had lived
      on those subscriptions during some years; and he could not without
      disgrace omit to perform his part of the contract. His friends repeatedly
      exhorted him to make an effort; and he repeatedly resolved to do so. But,
      notwithstanding their exhortations and his resolutions, month followed
      month, year followed year, and nothing was done. He prayed fervently
      against his idleness; he determined, as often as he received the
      sacrament, that he would no longer doze away and trifle away his time; but
      the spell under which he lay resisted prayer and sacrament. His private
      notes at this time are made up of self-reproaches. &ldquo;My indolence,&rdquo; he
      wrote on Easter eve in 1764, &ldquo;has sunk into grosser sluggishness. A kind
      of strange oblivion has overspread me, so that I know not what has become
      of the last year.&rdquo; Easter 1765 came, and found him still in the same
      state, &ldquo;My time,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;has been unprofitably spent, and seems as a
      dream that has left nothing behind. My memory grows confused, <span
      class="pagenum">200</span><a name="link200" id="link200"></a>and I know
      not how the days pass over me.&rdquo; Happily for his honour, the charm which
      held him captive was at length broken by no gentle or friendly hand. He
      had been weak enough to pay serious attention to a story about a ghost
      which haunted a house in Cock Lane, and had actually gone himself, with
      some of his friends, at one in the morning, to St. John&rsquo;s Church,
      Clerkenwell, in the hope of receiving a communication from the perturbed
      spirit. But the spirit, though adjured with all solemnity, remained
      obstinately silent; and it soon appeared that a naughty girl of eleven had
      been amusing herself by making fools of so many philosophers. Churchill,
      who, confident in his powers, drunk with popularity, and burning with
      party spirit, was looking for some man of established fame and Tory
      politics to insult, celebrated the Cock Lane Ghost in three cantos,
      nicknamed Johnson Pomposo, asked where the book was which had been so long
      promised and so liberally paid for, and directly accused the great
      moralist of cheating. This terrible word proved effectual; and in October
      1765 appeared, after a delay of nine years, the new edition of Shakspeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      This publication saved Johnson&rsquo;s character for honesty, but added nothing
      to the fame of his abilities and learning. The preface, though it contains
      some good passages, is not in his best manner. The most valuable notes are
      those in which he had an opportunity of showing how attentively he had
      during many years observed human life and human nature. The best specimen
      is the note on the character of Polonius. Nothing so good is to be found
      even in Wilhelm Meister&rsquo;s admirable examination of Hamlet. But here praise
      must end. It would be difficult to name a more <span class="pagenum">201</span><a
      name="link201" id="link201"></a>slovenly, a more worthless, edition of any
      great classic. The reader may turn over play after play without finding
      one happy conjectural emendation, or one ingenious and satisfactory
      explanation of a passage which had baffled preceding commentators. Johnson
      had, in his Prospectus, told the world that he was peculiarly fitted for
      the task which he had undertaken, because he had, as a lexicographer, been
      under the necessity of taking a wider view of the English lan guage than
      any of his predecessors. That his knowledge of our literature was
      extensive is indisputable. But, unfortunately, he had altogether neglected
      that very part of our literature with which it is especially desirable
      that an editor of Shakspeare should be conversant. It is dangerous to
      assert a negative. Yet little will be risked by the assertion, that in the
      two folio volumes of the English Dictionary there is not a single passage
      quoted from any dramatist of the Elizabethan age, except Shakspeare and
      Ben. Even from Ben the quotations are few. Johnson might easily, in a few
      months, have made himself well acquainted with every old play that was
      extant. But it never seems to have occurred to him that this was a
      necessary preparation for the work which he had undertaken. He would
      doubtless have admitted that it would be the height of absurdity in a man
      who was not familiar with the works of Æsehylus and Euripides to publish
      an edition of Sophocles. Yet he ventured to publish an edition of
      Shakspeare, without having ever in his life, as far as can be discovered,
      read a single scene of Massinger, Ford, Decker, Webster, Marlow, Beaumont,
      or Fletcher. His detractors were noisy and scurrilous. Those who most
      loved and honoured him had little to say in praise of the manner in which
      he had <span class="pagenum">202</span><a name="link202" id="link202"></a>discharged
      the duty of a commentator. He had, however, acquitted himself of a debt
      which had long lain heavy on his conscience; and he sank back into the
      repose from which the sting of satire had roused him. He long continued to
      live upon the fame which he had already won. He was honoured by the
      University of Oxford with a Doctor&rsquo;s degree, by the Royal Academy with a
      professorship, and by the King with an interview, in which his Majesty
      most graciously expressed a hope that so excellent a writer would not
      cease to write. In the interval, however, between 1765 and 1775 Johnson
      published only two or three political tracts, the longest of which he
      could have produced in forty-eight hours, if he had worked as he worked on
      the Life of Savage and on Rasselas.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though his pen was now idle, his tongue was active. The influence
      exercised by his conversation, directly upon those with whom he lived, and
      indirectly on the whole literary world, was altogether without a parallel.
      His colloquial talents were indeed of the highest order. He had strong
      sense, quick discernment, wit, humour, immense knowledge of literature and
      of life, and an infinite store of curious anecdotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As respected style, he spoke far better than he wrote Every sentence which
      dropped from his lips was as correct in structure as the most nicely
      balanced period of the Rambler. But in his talk there were no pompous
      triads, and little more than a fair proportion of words in <i>osity</i>
      and <i>ation</i>. All was simplicity, ease, and vigour. He uttered his
      short, weighty, and pointed sentences with a power of voice, and a
      justness and energy of emphasis, of which the effect was rather increased
      than diminished by the rollings of his huge form, and by the asthmatic
      gaspings and puffings in which the peals <span class="pagenum">203</span><a
      name="link203" id="link203"></a>of his eloquence generally ended. Nor did
      the laziness which made him unwilling to sit down to his desk prevent him
      from giving instruction or entertainment orally. To discuss questions of
      taste, of learning, of casuistry, in language so exact and so forcible
      that it might have been printed without the alteration of a word, was to
      him no exertion, but a pleasure. He loved, as he said, to fold his legs
      and have his talk out. He was ready to bestow the overflowings of his
      full, mind on anybody who would start a subject, on a fellow-passenger in
      a stage coach, or on the person who sate at the same table with him in an
      eating house. But his conversation was nowhere so brilliant and striking
      as when he was surrounded by a few friends, whose abilities and knowledge
      enabled them, as he once expressed it, to send him back every ball that he
      threw. Some of these, in 1704, formed themselves into a club, which
      gradually became a formidable power in the commonwealth of letters. The
      verdicts pronounced by this conclave on new books were speedily known over
      all London, and were sufficient to sell off a whole edition in a day, or
      to condemn the sheets to the service of the trunk-maker and the
      pastry-cook. Nor shall we think this strange when we consider what great
      and various talents and acquirements met in the little fraternity.
      Goldsmith was the representative of poetry and light literature, Reynolds
      of the arts, Burke of political eloquence and political philosophy. There,
      too, were Gibbon, the greatest historian, and Jones, the greatest
      linguist, of the age. Garrick brought to the meetings his inexhaustible
      pleasantry, his incomparable mimicry, and his consummate knowledge of
      stage effect. Among the most constant attendants were two high-born and
      high-bred gentlemen, closely bound together <span class="pagenum">204</span><a
      name="link204" id="link204"></a>by friendship, but of widely different
      characters and habits; Bennet Langton, distinguished by his skill in Greek
      literature, by the orthodoxy of his opinions, and by the sanctity of his
      life; and Topham Beauclerk, renowned for his amours, his knowledge of the
      gay world, his fastidious taste, and his sarcastic wit. To predominate
      over such a society was not easy. Yet even over such a society Johnson
      predominated. Burke might indeed have disputed the supremacy to which
      others were under the necessity of submitting. But Burke, though not
      generally a very patient listener, was content to take the second part
      when Johnson was present; and the club itself, consisting of so many
      eminent men, is to this day popularly designated as Johnson&rsquo;s Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the members of this celebrated body was one to whom it has owed the
      greater part of its celebrity, yet who was regarded with little respect by
      his brethren, and had not without difficulty obtained a seat among them.
      This was James Boswell, a young Scotch lawyer, heir to an honourable name
      and a fair estate. That he was a coxcomb, and a bore, weak, vain, pushing,
      curious, garrulous, was obvious to all who were acquainted with him. That
      he could not reason, that he had no wit, no humour, no eloquence, is
      apparent from his writings. And yet his writings are read beyond the
      Mississippi, and under the Southern Cross, and are likely to be read as
      long as the English exists, either as a living or as a dead language.
      Nature had made him a slave and an idolater. His mind resembled those
      creepers which the botanists call parasites, and which can subsist only by
      clinging round the stems and imbibing the juices of stronger plants. He
      must have fastened himself on somebody. He might <span class="pagenum">205</span><a
      name="link205" id="link205"></a>have fastened himself on Wilkes, and have
      become the fiercest patriot in the Bill of Rights Society. He might have
      fastened himself on Whitfield, and have become the loudest field preacher
      among the Calvinistic Methodists. In a happy hour he fastened himself on
      Johnson. The pair might seem ill matched. For Johnson had early been
      prejudiced against Boswell&rsquo;s country. To a man of Johnson&rsquo;s strong
      understanding and irritable temper, the silly egotism and adulation of
      Boswell must have been as teasing as the constant buzz of a fly. Johnson
      hated to be questioned; and Boswell was eternally catechising him on all
      kinds of subjects, and sometimes propounded such questions as &ldquo;What would
      you do, sir, if you were locked up in a tower with a baby?&rdquo; Johnson was a
      water-drinker; and Boswell was a wine-bibber, and indeed little better
      than a habitual sot. It was impossible that there should be perfect
      harmony between two such companions. Indeed, the great man was sometimes
      provoked into fits of passion in which he said things which the small man,
      during a few hours, seriously resented. Every quarrel, however, was soon
      made up. During twenty years the disciple continued to worship the master:
      the master continued to scold the disciple, to sneer at him, and to love
      him. The two friends ordinarily resided at a great distance from each
      other. Boswell practised in the Parliament House of Edinburgh, and could
      pay only occasional visits to London. During those visits his chief
      business was to watch Johnson, to discover all Johnson&rsquo;s habits, to turn
      the conversation to subjects about which Johnson was likely to say
      something remarkable, and to fill quarto note books with minutes of what
      Johnson had said. In this way were gathered the materials <span
      class="pagenum">206</span><a name="link206" id="link206"></a>out of which
      was afterwards constructed the most interesting biographical work in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the club began to exist, Johnson formed a connection less
      important indeed to his fame, but much more important to his happiness,
      than his connection with Boswell. Henry Thrale, one of the most opulent
      brewers in the kingdom, a man of sound and cultivated understanding, rigid
      principles, and liberal spirit, was married to one of those clever,
      kind-hearted, engaging, vain, pert young women, who are perpetually doing
      or saying what is not exactly right, but who do or say what they may, are
      always agreeable. In 1765 the Thrales became acquainted with Johnson; and
      the acquaintance ripened last into friendship. They were astonished and
      delighted by the brilliancy of his conversation. They were flattered by
      finding that a man so widely celebrated preferred their house to any other
      in London. Even the peculiarities which seemed to unfit him for civilised
      society, his gesticulations, his rollings, his puffings, his mutterings,
      the strange way in which he put on his clothes, the ravenous eagerness
      with which he devoured his dinner, his fits of melancholy, his fits of
      anger, his frequent rudeness, his occasional ferocity, increased the
      interest which his new associates took in him. For these things were the
      cruel marks left behind by a life which had been one long conflict with
      disease and with adversity. In a vulgar hack writer such oddities would
      have excited only disgust. But in a man of genius, learning, and virtue
      their effect was to add pity to admiration and esteem. Johnson soon had an
      apartment at the brewery in Southwark, and a still more pleasant apartment
      at the villa of his friends on Streatham Common. A large part of every
      year he passed in those abodes, abodes <span class="pagenum">207</span><a
      name="link207" id="link207"></a>which must have seemed magnificent and
      luxurious indeed, when compared with the dens in which he had generally
      been lodged. But his chief pleasures were derived from what the astronomer
      of his Abyssinian tale called &ldquo;the endearing elegance of female
      friendship.&rdquo; Mrs. Thrale rallied him, soothed him, coaxed him, and, if she
      sometimes provoked him by her flippancy, made ample amends by listening to
      his reproofs with angelic sweetness of temper. When he was diseased in
      body and in mind, she was the most tender of nurses. No comfort that
      wealth could purchase, no contrivance that womanly ingenuity, set to work
      by womanly compassion, could devise, was wanting to his sick room. He
      requited her kindness by an affection pure as the affection of a father,
      yet delicately tinged with a gallantry, which, though awkward, must have
      been more flattering than the attentions of a crowd of the fools who
      gloried in the names, now obsolete, of Buck and Maccaroni. It should seem
      that a full half of Johnson&rsquo;s life, during about sixteen years, was passed
      under the roof of the Thrales. He accompanied the family sometimes to
      Bath, and sometimes to Brighton, once to Wales, and once to Paris. But he
      had at the same time a house in one of the narrow and gloomy courts on the
      north of Fleet Street. In the garrets was his library, a large and
      miscellaneous collection of books, falling to pieces and begrimed with
      dust. On a lower floor he sometimes, but very rarely, regaled a friend
      with a plain dinner, a veal pie, or a leg of lamb and spinage, and a rice
      pudding. Nor was the dwelling uninhabited during his long absences. It was
      the home of the most extraordinary assemblage of inmates that ever was
      brought together. At the head of the establishment Johnson <span
      class="pagenum">208</span><a name="link208" id="link208"></a>had placed an
      old lady named Williams, whose chief recommendations were her blindness
      and her poverty. But, in spite of her murmurs and reproaches, he gave an
      asylum to another lady who was as poor as herself, Mrs. Desmoulins, whose
      family he had known many years before in Staffordshire. Room was found for
      the daughter of Mrs. Desmoulins, and for another destitute damsel, who was
      generally addressed as Miss Carmichael, but whom her generous host called
      Polly. An old quack doctor named Levett, who bled and dosed coal-heavers
      and hackney coachmen, and received for fees crusts of bread, bits of
      bacon, glasses of gin, and sometimes a little copper, completed this
      strange menagerie. All these poor creatures were at constant war with each
      other, and with Johnson&rsquo;s negro servant Frank. Sometimes, indeed, they
      transferred their hostilities from the servant to the master, complained
      that a better table was not kept for them, and railed or maundered till
      their benefactor was glad to make his escape to Streatham, or to the Mitre
      Tavern. And yet he, who was generally the haughtiest and most irritable of
      mankind, who was but too prompt to resent anything which looked like a
      slight on the part of a purse-proud bookseller, or of a noble and powerful
      patron, bore patiently from mendicants, who, but for his bounty, must have
      gone to the workhouse, insults more provoking than those for which he had
      knocked down Osborne and bidden defiance to Chesterfield. Year after year
      Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Desmoulins, Polly and Levett, continued to torment
      him and to live upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course of life which has been described was interrupted in Johnson&rsquo;s
      sixty-fourth year by an important event. He had early read an account of
      the Hebrides, <span class="pagenum">209</span><a name="link209"
       id="link209"></a>and had been much interested by learning that there was
      so near him a land peopled by a race which was still as rude and simple as
      in the middle ages. A wish to become intimately acquainted with a state of
      society so utterly unlike all that he had ever seen frequently crossed his
      mind. But it is not probable that his curiosity would have overcome his
      habitual sluggishness, and his love of the smoke, the mud, and the cries
      of London, had not Boswell importuned him to attempt the adventure, and
      offered to be his squire. At length, in August 1773, Johnson crossed the
      Highland line, and plunged courageously into what was then considered, by
      most Englishmen, as a dreary and perilous wilderness. After wandering
      about two months through the Celtic region, sometimes in rude boats which
      did not protect him from the rain, and sometimes on small shaggy ponies
      which could hardly bear his weight, he returned to his old haunts with a
      mind full of new images and new theories. During the following year he
      employed himself in recording his adventures. About the beginning of 1775,
      his Journey to the Hebrides was published, and was, during some weeks, the
      chief subject of conversation in all circles in which any attention was
      paid to literature. The book is still read with pleasure. The narrative is
      entertaining; the speculations, whether sound or unsound, are always
      ingenious; and the style, though too stiff and pompous, is somewhat easier
      and more graceful than that of his early writings. His prejudice against
      the Scotch had at length become little more than matter of jest; and
      whatever remained of the old feeling had been effectually removed by the
      kind and respectful hospitality with which he had been received in every
      part of Scotland. <span class="pagenum">210</span><a name="link210"
       id="link210"></a>It was, of course, not to be expected that an Oxonian
      Tory should praise the Presbyterian polity and ritual, or that an eye
      accustomed to the hedgerows and parks of England should not be struck by
      the bareness of Berwickshire and East Lothian. But even in censure
      Johnson&rsquo;s tone is not unfriendly. The most enlightened Scotchmen, with
      Lord Mansfield at their head, were well pleased. But some foolish and
      ignorant Scotchmen were moved to anger by a little unpalatable truth which
      was mingled with much eulogy, and assailed him whom they chose to consider
      as the enemy of their country with libels much more dishonourable to their
      country than anything that he had ever said or written. They published
      paragraphs in the newspapers, articles in the magazines, sixpenny
      pamphlets, five shilling books. One scribbler abused Johnson for being
      blear-eved: another for being a pensioner; a third informed the world that
      one of the Doctor&rsquo;s uncles had been convicted of felony in Scotland, and
      had found that there was in that country one tree capable of supporting
      the weight of an Englishman. Macpherson, whose Fingal had been proved in
      the Journey to be an impudent forgery, threatened to take vengeance with a
      cane. The only effect of this threat was that Johnson reiterated the
      charge of forgery in the most contemptuous terms, and walked about, during
      some time, with a cudgel, which, if the impostor had not been too wise to
      encounter it, would assuredly have descended upon him, to borrow the
      sublime language of his own epic poem, &ldquo;like a hammer on the red son of
      the furnace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of other assailants Johnson took no notice whatever. He had early resolved
      never to be drawn into controversy; and he adhered to his resolution with
      a steadfastness <span class="pagenum">211</span><a name="link211"
       id="link211"></a>which is the more extraordinary, because he was, both
      intellectually and morally, of the stuff of which controversialists, are
      made. In conversation, he was a singularly eager, acute, and pertinacious
      disputant. When at a loss for good reasons, he had recourse to sophistry;
      and, when heated by altercation, he made unsparing use of sarcasm and
      invective. But, when he took his pen in his hand, his whole character
      seemed to be changed. A hundred bad writers misrepresented him and reviled
      him; but not one of the hundred could boast of having been thought by him
      worthy of a refutation, or even of a retort. The Ken-ricks, Campbells,
      MacNicols, and Hendersons, did their best to annoy him, in the hope that
      he would give them importance by answering them. But the reader will in
      vain search his works for any allusion to Kenrick or Campbell, to MacNicol
      or Henderson. One Scotchman, bent on vindicating the fame of Scotch
      learning, defied him to the combat in a detestable Latin hexameter. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"Maxime, si tu vis, cupio contendere tecum.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But Johnson took no notice of the challenge. He had learned, both from his
      own observation and from literary history, in which he was deeply read,
      that the place of books in the public estimation is fixed, not by what is
      written about them, but by what is written in them; and that an author
      whose works are likely to live is very unwise if he stoops to wrangle with
      detractors whose works are certain to die. He always maintained that fame
      was a shuttlecock which could be kept up only by being beaten back, as
      well as beaten forward, and which would soon fall if there were only one
      battledore. No saying was oftener in his mouth than that, <span
      class="pagenum">212</span><a name="link212" id="link212"></a>fine
      apophthegm of Bentley, that no man was ever written down but by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, a few months after the appearance of the Journey to the
      Hebrides, Johnson did what none of his envious assailants could have done,
      and to a certain extent succeeded in writing himself down. The disputes
      between England and her American colonies had reached a point at which no
      amicable adjustment was possible. Civil war was evidently impending; and
      the ministers seem to have thought that the eloquence of Johnson might,
      with advantage be employed to inflame the nation against the opposition
      here, and against the rebels beyond the Atlantic. He had already written
      two or three tracts in defence of the foreign and domestic policy of the
      government; and those tracts, though hardly worthy of him, were much
      superior to the crowd of pamphlets which lay on the counters of Ahnon and
      Stockdale. But his Taxation No Tyranny was a pitiable failure. The very
      title was a silly phrase, which can have been recommended to his choice by
      nothing but a jingling alliteration which he ought to have despised. The
      arguments were such as boys use in debating societies. The pleasantry was
      as awkward as the gambols of a hippopotamus. Even Boswell was forced to
      own that, in this unfortunate piece, he could detect no trace of his
      master s powers. The general opinion was that the strong faculties which
      had produced the Dictionary and the Rambler were beginning to feel the
      effect of time and of disease, and that the old man would best consult his
      credit by writing no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was a great mistake. Johnson had failed, not because his mind was
      less vigorous than when he wrote Rasselas in the evenings of a week, but
      because he <span class="pagenum">213</span><a name="link213" id="link213"></a>had
      foolishly chosen, or suffered others to choose for him, a subject such as
      he would at no time have been competent to treat. He was in no sense a
      statesman. He never willingly read or thought or talked about affairs of
      state. He loved biography, literary history, the history of manners; but
      political history was positively distasteful to him. The question at issue
      between the colonies and the mother country was a question about which he
      had really nothing to say. He failed, therefore, as the greatest men must
      fail when they attempt to do that for which they are unfit; as Burke would
      have failed if Burke had tried to write comedies like those of Sheridan;
      as Reynolds would have failed if Reynolds had tried to paint landscapes
      like those of Wilson. Happily, Johnson soon had an opportunity of proving
      most signally that his failure was not to be ascribed to intellectual
      decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Easter Eve 1777, some persons, deputed by a meeting which consisted of
      forty of the first booksellers in London, called upon him. Though he had
      some scruples about doing business at that season, he received his
      visitors with much civility. They came to inform him that a new edition of
      the English poets, from Cowley downwards, was in contemplation, and to ask
      him to furnish short biographical prefaces. He readily undertook the task,
      a task for which he was pre-eminently qualified. His knowledge of the
      literary history of England since the Restoration was unrivalled. That
      knowledge he had derived partly from books, and partly from sources which
      had long been closed; from old Grub Street traditions; from the talk of
      forgotten poetasters and pamphleteers who had long been lying in parish
      vaults; from the recollections of such men as Gilbert Walmesley, who had
      conversed with <span class="pagenum">214</span><a name="link214"
       id="link214"></a>the wits of Button; Cibber, who had mutilated the plays
      of two generations of dramatists; Orrery, who had been admitted to the
      society of Swift; and Savage, who had rendered services of no very
      honourable kind to Pope. The biographer therefore sate down to his task
      with a mind full of matter, he had at first intended to give only a
      paragraph to every minor poet, and only four or five pages to the greatest
      name. But the flood of anecdote and criticism overflowed the narrow
      channel. The work, which was originally meant to consist only of a few
      sheets, swelled into ten volumes, small volumes, it is true, and not
      closely printed. The first four appeared in 1779, the remaining six in
      1781.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lives of the Poets, are, on the whole, the best of Johnson&rsquo;s works.
      The narratives are as entertaining as any novel. The remarks on life and
      on human nature are eminently shrewd and profound. The criticisms are
      often excellent, and, even when grossly and provokingly unjust, well
      deserve to be studied. For, however erroneous they may be, they are never
      silly. They are the judgments of a mind trammelled by prejudice and
      deficient in sensibility, but vigorous and acute. They therefore generally
      contain a portion of valuable truth which deserves to be separated from
      the alloy; and, at the very worst, they mean something, a praise to which
      much of what is called criticism in our time has no pretensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Savage&rsquo;s Life Johnson reprinted nearly as it had appeared in 1744.
      Whoever, after reading that life, will turn to the other lives will be
      struck by the difference of style. Since Johnson had been at ease in his
      circumstances he had written little and had talked much. When, therefore,
      he, after the lapse of years, resumed his <span class="pagenum">215</span><a
      name="link215" id="link215"></a>pen, the mannerism which he had contracted
      while he was in the constant habit of elaborate composition was less
      perceptible than formerly; and his diction frequently had a colloquial
      ease which it had formerly wanted. The improvement may be discerned by a
      skilful critic in the Journey to the Hebrides, and in the Lives of the
      Poets is so obvious that it cannot escape the notice of the most careless
      reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the lives the best are perhaps those of Cowley, Dryden, and Pope.
      The very worst is, beyond all doubt, that of Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great work at once became popular. There was, indeed, much just and
      much unjust censure: but even those who were loudest in blame were
      attracted by the book in spite of themselves. Malone computed the gains of
      the publishers at five or six thousand pounds. But the writer was very
      poorly remunerated. Intending at first to write very short prefaces, he
      had stipulated for only two hundred guineas. The booksellers, when they
      saw how far his performance had surpassed his promise, added only another
      hundred. Indeed, Johnson, though he did not despise, or affect to despise,
      money, and though his strong sense and long experience ought to have
      qualified him to protect his own interests, seems to have been singularly
      unskilful and unlucky in his literary bargains. He was generally reputed
      the first English writer of his time. Yet several writers of his time sold
      their copyrights for sums such as he never ventured to ask. To give a
      single instance, Robertson received four thousand five hundred pounds for
      the History of Charles V.; and it is no disrespect to the memory of
      Robertson to say that the History of Charles V. is both a less valuable
      and a less amusing book than the Lives of the Poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson <span class="pagenum">216</span><a name="link216" id="link216"></a>was
      now in his seventy-second year. The infirmities of age were coming last
      upon him. That inevitable event of which he never thought without horror
      was brought near to him; and his whole life was darkened by the shadow of
      death. He had often to pay the cruel price of longevity. Every year he
      lost what could never be replaced. The strange dependents to whom he had
      given shelter, and to whom, in spite of their faults, he was strongly
      attached by habit, dropped off one by one; and, in the silence of his
      home, he regretted even the noise of their scolding matches. The kind and
      generous Thrale was no more; and it would have been well if his wife had
      been laid beside him. But she survived to be the laughing-stock of those
      who had envied her, and to draw from the eyes of the old man who had loved
      her beyond anything in the world tears far more bitter than he would have
      shed over her grave. With some estimable and many agreeable qualities, she
      was not made to be independent. The control of a mind more steadfast than
      her own was necessary to her respectability. While she was restrained by
      her husband, a man of sense and firmness, indulgent to her taste in
      trifles, but always the undisputed master of his house, her worst offences
      had been impertinent jokes, white lies, and short fits of pettishness
      ending in sunny good humour. But he was gone; and she was left an opulent
      widow of forty, with strong sensibility, volatile fancy, and slender
      judgment. She soon fell in love with a music-master from Brescia, in whom
      nobody but herself could discover anything to admire. Her pride, and
      perhaps some better feelings, struggled hard against this degrading
      passion. But the struggle irritated her nerves, soured her temper, and at
      length endangered her health. <span class="pagenum">217</span><a
      name="link217" id="link217"></a>Conscious that her choice was one which
      Johnson could not approve, she became desirous to escape from his
      inspection. Her manner towards him changed. She was sometimes cold and
      sometimes petulant. She did not conceal her joy when he left Streatham;
      she never pressed him to return; and, if he came unbidden, she received
      him in a manner which convinced him that he was no longer a welcome guest.
      He took the very intelligible hints which she gave. He read, for the last
      time, a chapter of the Greek Testament in the library which had been
      formed by himself. In a solemn and tender prayer he commended the house
      and its inmates to the Divine protection, and, with emotions which choked
      his voice and convulsed his powerful frame, left for ever that beloved
      home for the gloomy and desolate house behind Fleet Street, where the few
      and evil days which still remained to him were to run out. Here, in June
      1788, he had a paralytic stroke, from which, however, he recovered, and
      which does not appear to have at all impaired his intellectual faculties.
      But other maladies came thick upon him. His asthma tormented him day and
      night. Dropsical symptoms made their appearance. While sinking under a
      Complication of diseases, he heard that the woman whose friendship had
      been the chief happiness of sixteen years of his life had married an
      Italian fiddler; that all London was crying shame upon her; and that the
      newspapers and magazines were filled with allusions to the Ephesian
      matron, and the two pictures in Hamlet. He vehemently said that he would
      try to forget her existence. He never uttered her name. Every memorial of
      her which met his eye he flung into the fire. She meanwhile fled from the
      laughter and hisses of her countrymen and countrywomen <span
      class="pagenum">218</span><a name="link218" id="link218"></a>to a land
      where she was unknown, hastened across Mount Cenis, and learned, while
      passing a merry Christmas of concerts and lemonade parties at Milan, that
      the great man with whose name hers is inseparably associated had ceased to
      exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, in spite of much mental and bodily affliction, clung vehemently to
      life. The feeling described in that fine but gloomy paper which closes the
      series of his Idlers seemed to grow stronger in him as his last hour drew
      near. He fancied that he should be able to draw his breath more easily in
      a southern climate, and would probably have set out for Rome and Naples,
      but for his fear of the expense of the journey. That expense, indeed, he
      had the means of defraying; for he had laid up about two thousand pounds,
      the fruit of labours which had made the fortune of several publishers. But
      he was unwilling to break in upon this hoard; and he seems to have wished
      even to keep its existence a secret. Some of his friends hoped that the
      government might be induced to increase his pension to six hundred pounds
      a year: but this hope was disappointed; and he resolved to stand one
      English winter more. That winter was his last. His legs grew weaker; his
      breath grew shorter; the fatal water gathered fast, in spite of incisions
      which he, courageous against pain, but timid against death, urged his
      surgeons to make deeper and deeper. Though the tender care which had
      mitigated his sufferings during months of sickness at Streatham was
      withdrawn, he was not left desolate. The ablest physicians and surgeons
      attended him, and refused to accept fees from him. Burke parted from him
      with deep emotion. Windham sate much in the sick-room, arranged the
      pillows, and sent his own servant to watch a night by the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances <span class="pagenum">219</span><a name="link219" id="link219"></a>Burney,
      whom the old man had cherished with fatherly kindness, stood weeping at
      the door; while Langton, whose piety eminently qualified him to be an
      adviser and comforter at such a time, received the last pressure of his
      friend&rsquo;s hand within. When at length the moment, dreaded through so many
      years, came close, the dark cloud passed away from Johnson&rsquo;s mind. His
      temper became unusually patient and gentle; he ceased to think with terror
      of death, and of that which lies beyond death; and he spoke much of the
      mercy of God, and of the propitiation of Christ. In this serene frame of
      mind he died on the 13th of December, 1781. He was laid, a week later, in
      Westminster Abbey, among the eminent men of whom he had been the
      historian,&mdash;Cowley and Denham, Dry-den and Congreve, Gay, Prior, and
      Addison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his death the popularity of his works&mdash;the Lives of the Poets,
      and, perhaps, the Vanity of Human Wishes, excepted&mdash;has greatly
      diminished. His Dictionary has been altered by editors till it can
      scarcely be called his. An allusion to his Rambler or his Idler is not
      readily apprehended in literary circles. The fame even of Rasselas has
      grown somewhat dim. But, though the celebrity of the writings may have
      declined, the celebrity of the writer, strange to say, is as great as
      ever. Boswell&rsquo;s book has done for him more than the best of his own books
      could do. The memory of other authors is kept alive by their works. But
      the memory of Johnson keeps many of his works alive. The old philosopher
      is still among us in the brown coat with the metal buttons and the shirt
      which ought to be at wash, blinking, puffing, rolling his head, drumming
      with his fingers, tearing his meat like a tiger, and swallowing his tea in
      oceans. No human being who <span class="pagenum">220</span><a
      name="link220" id="link220"></a>has been more than seventy years in the
      grave is so well known to us. And it is but just to say that our intimate
      acquaintance with what he would himself have called the aufractuosities of
      his intellect and of his temper serves only to strengthen our conviction
      that he was both a great and a good man.

      WILLIAM PITT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, January 1859.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>illiam Pitt, <span
      class="pagenum">221</span><a name="link221" id="link221"></a>the second
      son of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, and of Lady Hester Grenville,
      daughter of Hester, Countess Temple, was born on the 28th of May, 1759.
      The child inherited a name which, at the time of his birth, was the most
      illustrious in the civilised world, and was pronounced by every Englishman
      with pride, and by every enemy of England with mingled admiration and
      terror. During the first year of his life, every month had its
      illuminations and bonfires, and every wind brought some messenger charged
      with joyful tidings and hostile standards. In Westphalia the English
      infantry won a great battle which arrested the armies of Louis the
      Fifteenth in the midst of a career of conquest; Boscawen defeated one
      French fleet on the coast of Portugal; Hawke put to flight another in the
      Bay of Biscay; Johnson took Niagara; Amherst took Ticonderoga; Wolfe died
      by the most enviable of deaths under the walls of Quebec; Clive destroyed
      a Dutch armament in the Hooghly, and established the English supremacy in
      Bengal; Coote routed Lally at Wandewash, and established the English
      supremacy in the Carnatic. The nation, while loudly applauding the
      successful warriors, considered them all, on sea and on land, in Europe,
      in America, <span class="pagenum">222</span><a name="link222" id="link222"></a>and
      in Asia, merely as instruments which received their direction from one
      superior mind. It was the great William Pitt, the great commoner, who had
      vanquished French marshals in Germany, and French admirals on the
      Atlantic; who had conquered for his country one great empire on the frozen
      shores of Ontario, and another under the tropical sun near the mouths of
      the Ganges, it was not in the nature of things that popularity such as he
      at this time enjoyed should be permanent. That popularity had lost its
      gloss before his children were old enough to understand that their father
      was a great man. He was at length placed in situations in which neither
      his talents for administration nor his talents for debate appeared to the
      best advantage. The energy and decision which Lad eminently fitted him for
      the direction of war were not needed in time of peace. The lofty and
      spirit-stirring eloquence which had made him supreme in the House of
      Commons often fell dead on the House of Lords. A cruel malady racked his
      joints, and left his joints only to fall on his nerves and on his brain.
      During the closing years of his life, he was odious to the court, and yet
      was not on cordial terms with the great body of the opposition. Chatham
      was only the ruin of Pitt, but an awful and majestic ruin, not to be
      contemplated by any man of sense and feeling without emotions resembling
      those which are excited by the remains of the Parthenon and of the
      Coliseum. In one respect the old statesman was eminently happy. Whatever
      might be the vicissitudes of his public life, he never failed to find
      peace and love by his own hearth. Fie loved all his children, and was
      loved by them; and, of all his children, the one of whom he was fondest
      and proudest was his second son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">223</span><a name="link223" id="link223"></a>child&rsquo;s
      genius and ambition displayed themselves with a rare and almost unnatural
      precocity. At seven, the interest which he took in grave subjects, the
      ardour with which he pursued his studies, and the sense and vivacity of
      his remarks on books and on events, amazed his parents and instructors.
      One of his sayings of this date was reported to his mother by his tutor.
      In August, 1706, when the world was agitated by the news that Mr. Pitt had
      become Earl of Chatham, little William exclaimed: &ldquo;I am glad that I am not
      the eldest son. I want to speak in the House of Commons like papa.&rdquo; A
      letter is extant in which Lady Chatham, a woman of considerable abilities,
      remarked to her lord, that their younger son at twelve had left far behind
      him his elder brother, who was fifteen. &ldquo;The fineness,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;of
      William&rsquo;s mind makes him enjoy with the greatest pleasure what would be
      above the reach of any other creature of his small age.&rdquo; At fourteen the
      lad was in intellect a man. Hayley, who met him at Lyme in the summer of
      1773, was astonished, delighted, and somewhat overawed, by hearing wit and
      wisdom from so young a mouth. The poet, indeed, was afterwards sorry that
      his shyness had prevented him from submitting the plan of an extensive
      literary work, which he was then meditating, to the judgment of this
      extraordinary boy. The boy, indeed, had already written a tragedy, bad of
      course, but not worse than the tragedies of his friend. This piece is
      still preserved at Chevening, and is in some respects highly curious.
      There is no love. The whole plot is political; and it is remarkable that
      the interest, such as it is, turns on a contest about a regency. On one
      side is a faithful servant of the Crown, on the other an ambitious and
      unprincipled conspirator. At length the King, <span class="pagenum">224</span><a
      name="link224" id="link224"></a>who had been missing, reappears, resumes
      his power, and rewards the faithful defender of his rights. A reader who
      should judge only by internal evidence would have no hesitation in
      pronouncing that the play was written by some Pittite poetaster at the
      time of the rejoicings for the recovery of George the Third in 1780.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasure with which William&rsquo;s parents observed the rapid development
      of his intellectual powers was alloyed by apprehensions about his health.
      He shot up alarmingly fast; he was often ill, and always weak; and it was
      feared that it would be impossible to rear a stripling so tall, so
      slender, and so feeble. Port wine was prescribed by his medical advisers:
      and it is said that he was, at fourteen, accustomed to take this agreeable
      physic in quantities which would, in our abstemious age, be thought much
      more than sufficient for any full-grown man. This regimen, though it would
      probably have killed ninety-nine boys out of a hundred, seems to have been
      well suited to the peculiarities of William&rsquo;s constitution; for at fifteen
      he ceased to be molested by disease, and, though never a strong man,
      continued, during many years of labour and anxiety, of nights passed in
      debate and of summers passed in London, to be a tolerably healthy one. It
      was probably on account of the delicacy of his frame that he was not
      educated like other boys of the same rank. Almost all the eminent English
      statesmen and orators to whom he was afterwards opposed or allied, North,
      Fox, Shelburne, Windham, Grey, Wellesley, Grenville, Sheridan, Canning,
      went through the training of great public schools. Lord Chatham had
      himself been a distinguished Etonian: and it is seldom that a
      distinguished Etonian forgets his obligations to Eton. But William&rsquo;s <span
      class="pagenum">225</span><a name="link225" id="link225"></a>infirmities
      required a vigilance and tenderness such as could be found only at home.
      He was therefore bred under the paternal roof. His studies were
      superintended by a clergyman named Wilson; and those studies, though often
      interrupted by illness, were prosecuted with extraordinary success. Before
      the lad had completed his fifteenth year, his knowledge both of the
      ancient languages and of mathematics was such as very few men of eighteen
      then carried up to college. He was therefore sent, towards the close of
      the year 1773, to Pembroke Hall, in the university of Cambridge. So young
      a student required much more than the ordinary care which a college tutor
      bestows on undergraduates. The governor, to whom the direction of
      William&rsquo;s academical life was confided, was a bachelor of arts named
      Pretyman, who had been senior wrangler in the preceding year, and who,
      though not a man of prepossessing appearance or brilliant parts, was
      eminently acute and laborious, a sound scholar, and an excellent
      geometrician. At Cambridge, Pretyman was, during more than two years, the
      inseparable companion, and indeed almost the only companion, of his pupil.
      A close and lasting friendship sprang up between the pair. The disciple
      was able, before he completed his twenty-eighth year, to make his
      preceptor Bishop of Lincoln and Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s; and the preceptor
      showed his gratitude by writing a life of the disciple, which enjoys the
      distinction of being the worst biographical work of its size in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt, till he graduated, had scarcely one acquaintance, attended chapel
      regularly morning and evening, dined every day in hall, and never went to
      a single evening party. At seventeen, he was admitted, after the bad
      fashion of those times, by right of birth, without <span class="pagenum">226</span><a
      name="link226" id="link226"></a>any examination, to the degree of Master
      of Arts. But he continued during some years to reside at college, and to
      apply himself vigorously, under Prettyman&rsquo;s direction, to the studies of
      the place, while mixing freely in the best academic society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stock of learning which Pitt laid in during this part of his life was
      certainly very extraordinary. In fact, it was all that he ever possessed;
      for he very early became too busy to have any spare time for books. The
      work in which he took the greatest delight was Newton&rsquo;s Principia. His
      liking for mathematics, indeed, amounted to a passion, which, in the
      opinion of his instructors, themselves distinguished mathematicians,
      required to be cheeked rather than encouraged. The acuteness and readiness
      with which he solved problems was pronounced by one of the ablest of the
      moderators, who in those days presided over the disputations in the
      schools, and conducted the examinations of the Senate House, to be
      unrivalled in the university. Nor was the youth&rsquo;s proficiency in classical
      learning less remarkable. In one respect, indeed, he appeared to
      disadvantage when compared with even second-rate and third-rate men from
      public schools. He had never, while under Wilson&rsquo;s care, been in the habit
      of composing in the ancient languages; and he therefore never acquired
      that knack of versification which is sometimes possessed by clever boys
      whose knowledge of the language and literature of Greece and Rome is very
      superficial. It would have been utterly out of his power to produce such
      charming elegiac lines as those in which Wellesley bade farewell to Eton,
      or such Virgilian hexameters as those in which Canning described the
      pilgrimage to Mecca. But it may be doubted whether any scholar has ever,
      at twenty, <span class="pagenum">227</span><a name="link227" id="link227"></a>had
      a more solid and profound knowledge of the two great tongues of the old
      civilised world. The facility with which he penetrated the meaning of the
      most intricate sentences in the Attic writers astonished veteran critics.
      He had set his heart on being intimately acquainted with all the extant
      poetry of Greece, and was not satisfied till he had mastered Lycophron&rsquo;s
      Cassandra, the most obscure work in the whole range of ancient literature.
      This strange rhapsody, the difficulties of which have perplexed and
      repelled many excellent scholars, &ldquo;he read,&rdquo; says his preceptor, &ldquo;with an
      ease at first sight, which, if I had not witnessed it, I should have
      thought beyond the compass of human intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To modern literature Pitt paid comparatively little attention. He knew no
      living language except French; and French he knew very imperfectly. With a
      few of the best English writers he was intimate, particularly with
      Shakspeare and Milton. The debate in Pandemonium, was, as it well deserved
      to be, one of his favourite passages; and his early friends used to talk,
      long after his death, of the just emphasis and the melodious cadence with
      which they had heard him recite the incomparable speech of Belial. He had
      indeed been carefully trained from infancy in the art of managing his
      voice, a voice naturally clear and deep-toned. His father, whose oratory
      owed no small part of its effect to that art, had been a most skilful and
      judicious instructor. At a later period, the wits of Brookes&rsquo;s, irritated
      by observing, night after night, how powerfully Pitt&rsquo;s sonorous elocution
      fascinated the rows of country gentlemen, reproached him with having been
      &ldquo;taught by his dad on a stool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His education, indeed, was well adapted to form a great <span
      class="pagenum">228</span><a name="link228" id="link228"></a>parliamentary
      speaker. One argument often urged against those classical studies which
      occupy so large a part of the early life of every gentleman bred in the
      south of our island is, that they prevent him from acquiring a command of
      his mother tongue, and that it is not unusual to meet with a youth of
      excellent parts, who writes Ciceronian Latin prose and Horatian Latin
      Aleaics, but who would find it impossible to express his thoughts in pure,
      perspicuous, and forcible English. There may perhaps be some truth in this
      observation. But the classical studies of Pitt were carried on in a
      peculiar manner, and had the effect of enriching his English vocabulary,
      and of making him wonderfully expert in the art of constructing correct
      English sentences. His practice was to look over a page or two of a Greek
      or Latin author, to make himself master of the meaning, and then to read
      the passage straight-forward into his own language. This practice, begun
      under his first teacher Wilson, was continued under Pretyman. It is not
      strange that a young man of great abilities, who had been exercised daily
      in this way during ten years, should have acquired an almost unrivalled
      power of putting his thoughts, without premeditation, into words well
      selected and well arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the remains of antiquity, the orations were those on which he
      bestowed the most minute examination. His favourite employment was to
      compare harangues on opposite sides of the same question, to analyse them,
      and to observe which of the arguments of the first speaker were refuted by
      the second, which were evaded, and which were left untouched. Nor was it
      only in books that he at this time studied the art of parliamentary
      fencing. When he was at home, he had frequent opportunities of hearing
      important debates <span class="pagenum">229</span><a name="link229"
       id="link229"></a>at Westminster; and he heard them, not only with interest
      and enjoyment, but with a close scientific attention resembling that with
      which a diligent pupil at Guy&rsquo;s Hospital watches every turn of the hand of
      a great surgeon through a difficult operation. On one of these occasions,
      Pitt, a youth whose abilities were as yet known onlv to his own family and
      to a small knot of college friends, was introduced on the steps of the
      throne in the House of Lords to Fox, who was his senior by eleven years,
      and who was already the greatest debater, and one of the greatest orators,
      that had appeared in England. Fox used afterwards to relate that, as the
      discussion proceeded, Pitt repeatedly turned to him, and said, &ldquo;But
      surely, Mr. Fox, that might be met thus;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Yes; but he lays himself
      open to this retort.&rdquo; What the particular criticisms were Fox had
      forgotten; but he said that he was much struck at the time by the
      precocity of a lad who, through the whole sitting, seemed to be thinking
      only how all the speeches on both sides could be answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the young man&rsquo;s visits to the House of Lords was a sad and
      memorable era in his life. He had not quite completed his nineteenth year,
      when, on the 7th of April, 1778, he attended his father to Westminster. A
      great debate was expected. It was known that France had recognised the
      independence of the United States. The Duke of Richmond was about to
      declare his opinion that all thought of sublimating those states ought to
      be relinquished. Chatham had always maintained that the resistance of the
      colonies to the mother country was justifiable. But he conceived, very
      erroneously, that on the day on which their independence should be
      acknowledged the greatness of England would be at an end. Though sinking
      under the weight of years and infirmities, <span class="pagenum">230</span><a
      name="link230" id="link230"></a>he determined, in spite of the entreaties
      of his family, to be in his place. His son supported him to a seat. The
      excitement and exertion were too much for the old man. In the very act of
      addressing the peers, he fell back in convulsions. A few weeks later his
      corpse was borne, with gloomy pomp, from the Painted Chamber to the Abbey.
      The favourite child and namesake of the deceased statesman followed the
      coffin as chief mourner, and saw it deposited in the transept where his
      own was destined to he.
    </p>
    <p>
      His elder brother, now Earl of Chatham, had means sufficient, and barely
      sufficient, to support the dignity of the peerage. The other members of
      the family were poorly provided for. William had little more than three
      hundred a year. It was necessary for him to follow a profession. He had
      already begun to eat his terms. In the spring of 1780 he came of age. He
      then quitted Cambridge, was called to the bar, took Chambers in Lincoln&rsquo;s
      Inn, and joined the western circuit. In the autumn of that year a General
      election took place; and he offered himself as a candidate for the
      university; but he was at the bottom of the poll. It is said that the
      grave doctors, who then sate, robed in scarlet, on the benches of
      Golgotha, thought it great presumption in so young a man to solicit so
      high a distinction. He was, however, at the request of a hereditary
      friend, the Duke of Rutland, brought into Parliament by Sir James Lowther
      for the borough of Appleby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dangers of the country were at that time such as might well have
      disturbed even a constant mind. Army after army had been sent in vain
      against the rebellious colonists of North America. On pitched fields of
      battle the advantage had been with the disciplined troops <span
      class="pagenum">231</span><a name="link231" id="link231"></a>of the mother
      country. But it was not on pitched fields of battle that the event of such
      a contest could be decided. An armed nation, with hunger and the Atlantic
      for auxiliaries, was not to be subjugated. Meanwhile the House of Bourbon,
      humbled to the dust a few years before by the genius and vigour of
      Chatham, had seized the opportunity of revenge. France and Spain were
      united against us, and had recently been joined by Holland. The command of
      the Mediterranean had been for a time lost. The British flag had been
      scarcely able to maintain itself in the British Channel. The northern
      powers professed neutrality; but their neutrality had a menacing aspect.
      In the East, Hyder had descended on the Carnatic, had destroyed the little
      army of Baillie, and had spread terror even to the ramparts of Fort St.
      George. The discontents of Ireland threatened nothing less than civil war.
      In England the authority of the government had sunk to the lowest point.
      The King and the House of Commons were alike unpopular. The cry for
      parliamentary reform was scarcely less loud and vehement than in the
      autumn of 1830. Formidable associations, headed, not by ordinary
      demagogues, but by men of high rank, stainless character, and
      distinguished ability, demanded a revision of the representative system.
      The populace, emboldened by the impotence and irresolution of the
      government, had recently broken loose from all restraint, besieged the
      chambers of the legislature, hustled peers, hunted bishops, attacked the
      residences of ambassadors, opened prisons, burned and pulled down houses.
      London had presented during some days the aspect of a city taken by storm;
      and it had been necessary to form a camp among the trees of Saint James&rsquo;s
      Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <span class="pagenum">232</span><a name="link232" id="link232"></a>spite
      of dangers and difficulties abroad and at home, George the Third, with a
      firmness which had little affinity with virtue or with wisdom, persisted
      in his determination to put down the American rebels by force of arms; and
      his ministers submitted their judgment to his. Some of them were probably
      actuated merely by selfish cupidity; but their chief, Lord North, a man of
      high honour, amiable temper, winning manners, lively wit, and excellent
      talents both for business and for debate, must be acquitted of all sordid
      motives. He remained at a post from which he had long wished and had
      repeatedly tried to escape, only because he had not sufficient fortitude
      to resist the entreaties and reproaches of the King, who silenced all
      arguments by passionately asking whether any gentleman, any man of spirit,
      could have the heart to desert a kind master in the hour of extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opposition consisted of two parties which had once been hostile to
      each other, and which had been very slowly, and, as it soon appeared, very
      imperfectly reconciled, but which at this conjuncture seemed to act
      together with cordiality. The larger of these parties consisted of the
      great body of the Whig aristocracy. Its head was Charles, Marquess of
      Rockingham, a man of sense and virtue, and in wealth and parliamentary
      interest equalled by very few of the English nobles, but afflicted with a
      nervous timidity which prevented him from taking a prominent part in
      debate, In the House of Commons, the adherents of Rockingham were led by
      Fox, whose dissipated habits and ruined fortunes were the talk of the
      whole town, but whose commanding genius, and whose sweet, generous, and
      affectionate disposition, extorted the admiration and love of those who
      most lamented the errors of his private <span class="pagenum">233</span><a
      name="link233" id="link233"></a>life. Burke, superior to Fox in largeness
      of comprehension, in extent of knowledge, and in splendour of imagination,
      but less skilled in that kind of logic and in that kind of rhetoric which
      convince and persuade great assemblies, was willing to be the lieutenant
      of a young chief who might have been his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smaller section of the opposition was composed of the old followers of
      Chatham. At their head was William, Earl of Shelburne, distinguished both
      as a statesman and as a lover of science and letters. With him were
      leagued Lord Camden, who had formerly held the Great Seal, and whose
      integrity, ability, and constitutional knowledge commanded the public
      respect; Barré, an eloquent and acrimonious declaimer; and Dunning, who
      had long held the first place at the English bar. It was to this party
      that Pitt was naturally attracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 26th of February 1781 he made his first speech, in favour of
      Burke&rsquo;s plan of economical reform. Fox stood up at the same moment, but
      instantly gave way. The lofty yet animated deportment of the young member,
      his perfect self-possession, the readiness with which he replied to the
      orators who had preceded him, the silver tones of his voice, the perfect
      structure of his unpremeditated sentences, astonished and delighted his
      hearers. Burke, moved even to tears, exclaimed, &ldquo;It is not a chip of the
      old block; it is the old block itself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pitt will be one of the first men
      in Parliament,&rdquo; said a member of the opposition to Fox. &ldquo;He is so
      already,&rdquo; answered Fox, in whose nature envy had no place. It is a curious
      fact, well remembered by some who were very recently living, that soon
      after this debate Pitt&rsquo;s name was put up by Fox at Brookes&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      On two subsequent occasions during that session Pitt <span class="pagenum">234</span><a
      name="link234" id="link234"></a>addressed the house, and on both fully
      sustained the reputation which he had acquired on his first appearance. In
      the summer, after the prorogation, he again went the western circuit, held
      several briefs, and acquitted himself in such a manner that he was highly
      complimented by Puller from the bench, and by Dunning at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 27th of November the Parliament reassembled. Only forty-eight hours
      before had arrived tidings of the surrender of Cornwallis and his army;
      and it had consequently been necessary to rewrite the royal speech. Every
      man in the kingdom, except the King, was now convinced that it was mere
      madness to think of conquering the United States. In the debate on the
      report of the address, Pitt spoke with even more energy and brilliancy
      than on any former occasion. He was warmly applauded by his allies; but it
      was remarked that no person on his own side of the house was so loud in
      eulogy as Henry Dundas, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, who spoke from the
      ministerial ranks. That able and versatile politician distinctly foresaw
      the approaching downfall of the government with which he was connected,
      and was preparing to make his own escape from the ruin. From that night
      dates his connection with Pitt, a connection which soon became a close
      intimacy, and which lasted till it was dissolved by death.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a fortnight later, Pitt spoke in the committee of supply on the army
      estimates. Symptoms of dissension had begun to appear on the Treasury
      bench. Lord George Germaine, the Secretary of State who was especially
      charged with the direction of the war in America, had held language not
      easily to be reconciled with declarations made by the First Lord of the
      Treasury. <span class="pagenum">235</span><a name="link235" id="link235"></a>Pitt
      noticed the discrepancy with much force and keenness. Lord George and Lord
      North began to whisper together; and Welbore Ellis, an ancient placeman
      who had been drawing salary almost every quarter since the days of Henry
      Pelham, bent down between them to put in a word. Such interruptions
      sometimes discompose veteran speakers. Pitt stopped, and, looking at the
      group, said, with admirable readiness, &ldquo;I shall wait till Nestor has
      composed the dispute between Agamemnon and Achilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After several defeats, or victories hardly to be distinguished from
      defeats, the ministry resigned. The King, reluctantly and ungraciously,
      consented to accept Rockingham as first minister. Fox and Shelburne became
      Secretaries of State. Lord John Cavendish, one of the most upright and
      honourable of men, was made Chancellor of the Exchequer. Thurlow, whose
      abilities and force of character had made him the dictator of the House of
      Lords, continued to hold the great seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Pitt was offered, through Shelburne, the Vice-Treasurership of Ireland,
      one of the easiest and most highly paid places in the gift of the Crown;
      but the offer was, without hesitation, declined. The young statesman had
      resolved to accept no post which did not entitle him to a seat in the
      cabinet: and, a few days later, he announced that resolution in the House
      of Commons. It must be remembered that the cabinet was then a much smaller
      and more select body than at present. We have seen cabinets of sixteen. In
      the time of our grandfathers a cabinet of ten or eleven was thought
      inconveniently large. Seven was an usual number. Even Burke, who had taken
      the lucrative office of paymaster, was not in the cabinet. Many therefore
      <span class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236" id="link236"></a>thought
      Pitt&rsquo;s declaration indecent. He himself was sorry that he had made it. The
      words, he said in private, had escaped him in the heat of speaking; and he
      had no sooner uttered them than he would have given the world to recall
      them. They, however, did him no harm with the public. The second William
      Pitt, it was said, had shown that he had inherited the spirit, as well as
      the genius, of the first. In the son, as in the father, there might
      perhaps be too much pride; but there was nothing low or sordid. It might
      be called arrogance in a young barrister, living in chambers on three
      hundred a year, to refuse a salary of five thousand a year, merely because
      he did not choose to bind himself to speak or vote for plans which he had
      no share in framing; but surely such arrogance was not very far removed
      from virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt gave a general support to the administration of Rockingham, but
      omitted, in the meantime, no opportunity of courting that Ultra-Whig party
      which the persecution of Wilkes and the Middlesex election had called into
      existence, and which the disastrous events of the war, and the triumph of
      republican principles in America, had made formidable both in numbers and
      in temper. He supported a motion for shortening the duration of
      Parliaments. He made a motion for a committee to examine into the state of
      the representation, and, in the speech by which that motion was
      introduced, avowed himself the enemy of the close boroughs, the
      strongholds of that corruption to which he attributed all the calamities
      of the nation, and which, as he phrased it in one of those exact and
      sonorous sentences of which he had a boundless command, had grown with the
      growth of England and strengthened with her strength, but had not
      diminished with her diminution <span class="pagenum">237</span><a
      name="link237" id="link237"></a>or decayed with her decay. On this
      occasion he was supported by Fox. The motion was lost by only twenty votes
      in a house of more than three hundred members. The reformers never again
      had so good a division till the year 1881.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new administration was strong in abilities, and was more popular than
      any administration which had held office since the first year of George
      the Third, but was hated by the King, hesitatingly supported by the
      Parliament, and torn by internal dissensions. The Chancellor was disliked
      and distrusted by almost all his colleagues. The two Secretaries of State
      regarded each other with no friendly feeling. The line between their
      departments had not been traced with precision; and there were
      consequently jealousies, encroachments, and complaints. It was all that
      Rockingham could do to keep the peace in his cabinet; and, before the
      cabinet had existed three months, Rockingham died.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant all was confusion. The adherents of the deceased statesman
      looked on the Duke of Portland as their chief. The King placed Shelburne
      at the head of the Treasury. Fox, Lord John Cavendish, and Burke,
      immediately resigned their offices; and the new prime minister was left to
      constitute a government out of very defective materials. His own
      parliamentary talents were great; but he could not be in the place where
      parliamentary talents were most needed. It was necessary to find some
      member of the House of Commons who could confront the great orators of the
      opposition; and Pitt alone had the eloquence and the courage which were
      required. He was offered the great place of Chancellor of the Exchequer;
      and he accepted it. He had scarcely completed his twenty-third year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">238</span><a name="link238" id="link238"></a>Parliament
      was speedily prorogued. During the recess, a negotiation for peace which
      had been commenced under Rockingham was brought to a successful
      termination. England acknowledged the independence of her revolted
      colonies; and she ceded to her European enemies some places in the
      Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico. But the terms which she obtained
      were quite as advantageous and honourable as the events of the war
      entitled her to expect, or as she was likely to obtain by persevering in a
      contest against immense odds. All her vital parts, all the real sources of
      her power, remained uninjured. She preserved even her dignity; for she
      ceded to the House of Bourbon only part of what she had won from that
      House in previous wars. She retained her Indian empire undiminished; and,
      in spite of the mightiest efforts of two great monarchies, her flag still
      waved on the rock of Gibraltar. There is not the slightest reason to
      believe that Fox, if he had remained in office, would have hesitated one
      moment about concluding a treaty on such conditions. Unhappily that great
      and most amiable man was, at this crisis, hurried by his passions into an
      error which made his genius and his virtues, during a long course of
      years, almost useless to his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that the great body of the House of Commons was divided into three
      parties, his own, that of North, and that of Shelburne; that none of those
      three parties was large enough to stand alone; that, therefore, unless two
      of them united, there must be a miserably feeble administration, or, more
      probably, a rapid succession of miserably feeble administrations, and this
      at a time when a strong government was essential to the prosperity and
      respectability of the nation. It was then necessary and right that there
      should be a coalition. <span class="pagenum">239</span><a name="link239"
       id="link239"></a>To every possible coalition there were objections. But,
      of all possible coalitions, that to which there were the fewest objections
      was undoubtedly a coalition between Shelburne and Fox. It would have been
      generally applauded by the followers of both. It might have been made
      without any sacrifice of public principle on the part of either.
      Unhappily, recent bickerings had left in the mind of Fox a profound
      dislike and distrust of Shelburne. Pitt attempted to mediate, and was
      authorised to invite Fox to return to the service of the Crown. &ldquo;Is Lord
      Shelburne,&rdquo; said Fox, &ldquo;to remain prime minister?&rdquo; Pitt answered in the
      affirmative. &ldquo;It is impossible that I can act under him,&rdquo; said Fox. &ldquo;Then
      negotiation is at an end,&rdquo; said Pitt; &ldquo;for I cannot betray him.&rdquo; Thus the
      two statesmen parted. They were never again in a private room together.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Fox and his friends would not treat with Shelburne, nothing remained to
      them but to treat with North. That fatal coalition which is emphatically
      called &ldquo;The Coalition&rdquo; was formed. Not three quarters of a year had
      elapsed since Fox and Burke had threatened North with impeachment, and had
      described him, night after night, as the most arbitrary, the most corrupt,
      the most incapable of ministers. They now allied themselves with him for
      the purpose of driving from office a statesman with whom they cannot be
      said to have differed as to any important question. Nor had they even the
      prudence and the patience to wait for some occasion on which they might,
      without inconsistency, have combined with their old enemies in opposition
      to the government. That nothing might be wanting to the scandal, the great
      orators, who had, during seven years, thundered against the war,
      determined <span class="pagenum">240</span><a name="link240" id="link240"></a>to
      join with the authors of that war in passing a vote of censure on the
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliament met before Christmas 1782. But it was not till January 1783
      that the preliminary treaties were signed. On the 17th of February they
      were taken into consideration by the House of Commons. There had been,
      during some days, floating rumours that Fox and North had coalesced; and
      the debate indicated but too clearly that those rumours were not
      unfounded. Pitt was suffering from indisposition: he did not rise till his
      own strength and that of his hearers were exhausted; and he was
      consequently less successful than on any former occasion. His admirers
      owned that his speech was feeble and petulant. He so far forgot himself as
      to advise Sheridan to confine himself to amusing theatrical audiences.
      This ignoble sarcasm gave Sheridan an opportunity of retorting with great
      felicity. &ldquo;After what I have seen and heard tonight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I really
      feel strongly tempted to venture on a competition with so great an artist
      as Ben Jonson, and to bring on the stage a second Angry Boy.&rdquo; On a
      division, the address proposed by the supporters of the government was
      rejected by a majority of sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pitt was not a man to be disheartened by a single failure, or to be
      put down by the most lively repartee. When, a few days later, the
      opposition proposed a resolution directly censuring the treaties, he spoke
      with an eloquence, energy, and dignity, which raised his fame and
      popularity higher than ever. To the coalition of Fox and North he alluded
      in language which drew forth tumultuous applause from his followers. &ldquo;If,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;this ill-omened and unnatural marriage be not yet consummated, I
      know of a just and <span class="pagenum">241</span><a name="link241"
       id="link241"></a>lawful impediment; and, in the name of the public weal, I
      forbid the banns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ministers were again left in a minority; and Shelburne consequently
      tendered his resignation. It was accepted; but the King struggled long and
      hard before he submitted to the terms dictated by Fox, whose faults he
      detested, and whose high spirit and powerful intellect he detested still
      more. The first place at the board of Treasury was repeatedly offered to
      Pitt; but the offer, though tempting, was steadfastly declined. The young
      man, whose judgment was as precocious as his eloquence, saw that his time
      was coming, but was not come, and was deaf to royal importunities and
      reproaches. His Majesty, bitterly complaining of Pitt&rsquo;s faintheartedness,
      tried to break the coalition. Every art of seduction was practised on
      North, but in vain. During several weeks the country remained without a
      government. It was not till all devices had failed, and till the aspect of
      the House of Commons became threatening, that the King gave way. The Duke
      of Portland was declared First Lord of the Treasury. Thurlow was
      dismissed. Fox and North became Secretaries of State, with power
      ostensibly equal. But Fox was the real prime minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year was far advanced before the new arrangements were completed; and
      nothing very important was done during the remainder of the session. Pitt,
      now seated on the opposition bench, brought the question of parliamentary
      reform a second time under the consideration of the Commons. He proposed
      to add to the House at once a hundred county members and several members
      for metropolitan districts, and to enact that every borough of which an
      election committee <span class="pagenum">242</span><a name="link242"
       id="link242"></a>should report that the majority of voters appeared to be
      corrupt should lose the franchise. The motion was rejected by 203 votes to
      140.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the prorogation, Pitt visited the Continent for the first and last
      time. His travelling companion was one of his most intimate friends, a
      young man of his own age, who had already distinguished himself in
      Parliament by an engaging natural eloquence, set off by the sweetest and
      most exquisitely modulated of human voices, and whose affectionate heart,
      caressing manners, and brilliant wit, made him the most delightful of
      companions, William Wilberforce. That was the time of Anglomania in
      France; and at Paris the son of the great Chatham was absolutely hunted by
      men of letters and women of fashion, and forced, much against his will,
      into political disputation. One remarkable saying which dropped from him
      during this tour has been preserved. A French gentleman expressed some
      surprise at the immense influence which Fox, a man of pleasure, ruined by
      the dice-box and the turf, exercised over the English nation. &ldquo;You have
      not,&rdquo; said Pitt, &ldquo;been under the wand of the magician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In November 1783 the Parliament met again. The government had irresistible
      strength in the House of Commons, and seemed to be scarcely less strong in
      the House of Lords, but was, in truth, surrounded on every side by
      dangers. The King was impatiently waiting for the moment fit which he
      could emancipate himself from a yoke which galled him so severely that he
      had more than once seriously thought of retiring to Hanover; and the King
      was scarcely more eager for a change than the nation. Fox and North had
      committed a fatal error. They ought to have known that coalitions <span
      class="pagenum">243</span><a name="link243" id="link243"></a>between
      parties which have long been hostile can succeed only when the wish for
      coalition pervades the lower ranks of both. If the leaders unite before
      there is any disposition to union among the followers, the probability is
      that there will be a mutiny in both camps, and that the two revolted
      armies will make a truce with each other, in order to be revenged on those
      by whom they think that they have been betrayed. Thus it was in 1783. At
      the beginning of that eventful year, North had been the recognised head of
      the old Tory party, which, though for a moment prostrated by the
      disastrous issue of the American war, was still a great power in the
      state. To him the clergy, the universities, and that large body of country
      gentlemen whose rallying cry was &ldquo;Church and King,&rdquo; had long looked up
      with respect and confidence. Fox had, on the other hand, been the idol of
      the Whigs, and of the whole body of Protestant dissenters. The coalition
      at once alienated the most zealous Tories from North, and the most zealous
      Whigs from Fox. The University of Oxford, which had marked its approbation
      of North&rsquo;s orthodoxy by electing him chancellor, the city of London, which
      had been during two and twenty years at war with the Court, were equally
      disgusted. Squires and rectors, who had inherited the principles of the
      cavaliers of the preceding century, could not forgive their old leader for
      combining with disloyal subjects in order to put a force on the sovereign.
      The members of the Bill of Rights Society and of the Reform Associations
      were enraged by learning that their favourite orator now called the great
      champion of tyranny and corruption his noble friend. Two great multitudes
      were at once left without any head, and both at once turned their eyes on
      Pitt. One party saw <span class="pagenum">244</span><a name="link244"
       id="link244"></a>in him the only man who could rescue the King; the other
      saw in him the only man who could purify the Parliament. He was supported
      on one side by Archbishop Markham, the preacher of divine right, and by
      Jenkinson, the captain of the Praetorian band of the King&rsquo;s friends; on
      the other side by Jebb and Priestley, Sawbridge and Cartwright, Jack
      Wilkes and Horne Tooke. On the benches of the House of Commons, however,
      the ranks of the ministerial majority were unbroken; and that any
      statesman would venture to brave such a majority was thought impossible.
      No prince of the Hanoverian line had ever, under any provocation, ventured
      to appeal from the representative body to the constituent body. The
      ministers, therefore, notwithstanding the sullen looks and muttered words
      of displeasure with which their suggestions were received in the closet,
      notwithstanding the roar of obloquy which was rising louder and louder
      every day from every corner of the island, thought themselves secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was their confidence in their strength that, as soon as the
      Parliament had met, they brought forward a singularly bold and original
      plan for the government of the British territories in India. What was
      proposed was that the whole authority, which till that time had been
      exercised over those territories by the East India Company, should be
      transferred to seven Commissioners who were to be named by Parliament, and
      were not to be removable at the pleasure of the Crown. Earl Fitzwilliam,
      the most intimate personal friend of Fox, was to be chairman of this
      board; and the eldest son of North was to be one of the members.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the outlines of the scheme were known, all the hatred which the
      coalition had excited burst forth <span class="pagenum">245</span><a
      name="link245" id="link245"></a>with an astounding explosion. The question
      which ought undoubtedly to have been considered as paramount to every
      other was, whether the proposed change was likely to be beneficial or
      injurious to the thirty millions of people who were subject to the
      Company. But that question cannot be said to have been even seriously
      discussed. Burke, who, whether right or wrong in the conclusions to which
      he came, had at least the merit of looking at the subject in the right
      point of view, vainly reminded his hearers of that mighty population whose
      daily rice might depend on a vote of the British Parliament. He spoke,
      with even more than his wonted power of thought and language, about the
      desolation of Rohilcund, about the spoliation of Benares, about the evil
      policy which had suffered the tanks of the Carnatic to go to ruin; but he
      could scarcely obtain a hearing. The contending parties, to their shame it
      must be said, would listen to none but English topics. Out of doors the
      cry against the ministry was almost universal. Town and country were
      united. Corporations exclaimed against the violation of the charter of the
      greatest corporation in the realm. Tories and democrats joined in
      pronouncing the proposed board an unconstitutional body. It was to consist
      of Fox&rsquo;s nominees. The effect of his bill was to give, not to the Crown,
      but to him personally, whether in office or in opposition, an enormous
      power, a patronage sufficient to counterbalance the patronage of the
      Treasury and of the Admiralty, and to decide the elections for fifty
      boroughs. He knew, it was said, that he was hateful alike to King and
      people; and he had devised a plan which would make him independent of
      both. Some nicknamed him Cromwell, and some Carlo Khan. Wilberforce, with
      his usual felicity of expression, <span class="pagenum">246</span><a
      name="link246" id="link246"></a>and with very unusual bitterness of
      feeling, described the scheme as the genuine offspring of the coalition,
      as marked with the features of both its parents, the corruption of one and
      the violence of the other. In spite of all opposition, however, the bill
      was supported in every stage by great majorities, was rapidly passed, and
      was sent up to the Lords. To the general astonishment, when the second
      readme was moved in the Upper House, the opposition proposed an
      adjournment, and carried it by eighty-seven votes to seventy-nine. The
      cause of this strange turn of fortune was soon known. Pitt&rsquo;s cousin, Earl
      Temple, had been in the royal closet, and had there been authorised to let
      it be known that His Majesty would consider all who voted for the bill as
      his enemies. The ignominious commission was performed; and instantly a
      troop of Lords of the Bedchamber, of Bishops who wished to be translated,
      and of Scotch peers who wished to be re-elected, made haste to change
      sides. On a later day, the Lords rejected the bill. Fox and North were
      immediately directed to send their seals to the palace by their Under
      Secretaries; and Pitt was appointed First Lord of the Treasury and
      Chancellor of the Exchequer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general opinion was, that there would be an immediate dissolution. But
      Pitt wisely determined to give the public feeling time to gather strength.
      On this point he differed from his kinsman Temple. The consequence was,
      that Temple, who had been appointed one of the Secretaries of State,
      resigned his office forty-eight hours after he had accepted it, and thus
      relieved the new government from a great load of unpopularity; for all men
      of sense and honour, however strong might be their dislike of the India
      Bill, disapproved of the manner <span class="pagenum">247</span><a
      name="link247" id="link247"></a>in which that bill had been thrown out.
      Temple carried away with him the scandal which the best friends of the new
      government could not but lament. The fame of the young prime minister
      preserved its whiteness. He could declare with perfect truth that, if
      unconstitutional machinations had been employed, he had been no party to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, however, surrounded by difficulties and dangers. In the House of
      Lords, indeed, he had a majority; nor could any orator of the opposition
      in that assembly be considered as a match for Thurlow, who was now again
      Chancellor, or for Camden, who cordially supported the son of his old
      friend Chatham. But in the other House there was not a single eminent
      speaker among the official men who sate round Pitt. His most useful
      assistant was Dundas, who, though he had not eloquence, had sense,
      knowledge, readiness, and boldness. On the opposite benches was a powerful
      majority, led by Fox, who was supported by Burke, North, and Sheridan. The
      heart of the young minister, stout as it was, almost died within him. He
      could not once close his eyes on the night which followed Temple&rsquo;s
      resignation. But, whatever his internal emotions might be, his language
      and deportment indicated nothing but unconquerable firmness and haughty
      confidence in his own powers. His contest against the House of Commons
      lasted from the 17th of December, 1783, to the 8th of March, 1781. In
      sixteen divisions the opposition triumphed. Again and again the King was
      requested to dismiss his ministers. But he was determined to go to Germany
      rather than yield. Pitt&rsquo;s resolution never wavered. The cry of the nation
      in his favour became vehement and almost furious. Addresses assuring him
      of public support came up daily from <span class="pagenum">248</span><a
      name="link248" id="link248"></a>every part of the kingdom. The freedom of
      the city of London was presented to him in a gold box. He went in state to
      receive this mark of distinction. he was sumptuously feasted in Grocers&rsquo;
      Hall; and the shopkeepers of the Strand and Fleet Street illuminated their
      houses in his honour. These things could not but produce an effect within
      the walls of Parliament. The ranks of the majority began to waver; a few
      passed over to the enemy; some skulked away; many were for capitulating
      while it was still possible to capitulate with the honours of war.
      Negotiations were opened with the view of forming an administration on a
      wide basis; but they had scarcely been opened when they were closed. The
      opposition demanded, as a preliminary article of the treaty, that Pitt
      should resign the Treasury; and with this demand Pitt steadfastly refused
      to comply. While the contest was raging, the Clerkship of the Pells, a
      sinecure place for life, worth three thousand a year, and tenable with a
      seat in the House of Commons, became vacant. The appointment was with the
      Chancellor of the Exchequer: nobody doubted that he would appoint himself;
      and nobody could have blamed him if he had done so: for such sinecure
      offices had always been defended on the ground that they enabled a few men
      of eminent abilities and small incomes to live without any profession, and
      to devote themselves to the service of the state. Pitt, in spite of the
      remonstrances of his friends, gave the Pells to his father&rsquo;s old adherent,
      Colonel Barré, a man distinguished by talent and eloquence, but poor and
      afflicted with blindness. By this arrangement a pension which the
      Rockingham administration had granted to Barré was saved to the public.
      Never was there a happier stroke of policy. About treaties, <span
      class="pagenum">249</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a>wars,
      expeditions, tariffs, budgets, there will always be room for dispute. The
      policy which is applauded by half the nation may be condemned by the other
      half. But pecuniary disinterestedness everybody comprehends. It is a great
      thing for a man who has only three hundred a year to be able to show that
      he considers three thousand a year as mere dirt beneath his feet, when
      compared with the public interest and the public esteem. Pitt had his
      reward. No minister was ever more rancorously libelled; but, even when he
      was known to be overwhelmed with debt, when millions were passing through
      his hands, when the wealthiest magnates of the realm were soliciting him
      for marquisates and garters, his bitterest enemies did not dare to accuse
      him of touching unlawful gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the hard fought fight ended. A final remonstrance, drawn up by
      Burke with admirable skill, was carried on the 8th of March by a single
      vote in a full House. Had the experiment been repeated, the supporters of
      the coalition would probably have been in a minority. But the supplies had
      been voted; the Mutiny Bill had been passed; and the Parliament was
      dissolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular constituent bodies all over the country were in general
      enthusiastic on the side of the new government. A hundred and sixty of the
      supporters of the coalition lost their seats. The First Lord of the
      Treasury himself came in at the head of the poll for the University of
      Cambridge. His young friend, Wilberforce, was elected knight of the great
      shire of York, in opposition to the whole influence of the Fitzwilliams,
      Cavendishes, Dundases, and Saviles. In the midst of such triumphs Pitt
      completed his twenty-fifth year. He was now the greatest subject that
      England had seen <span class="pagenum">250</span><a name="link250"
       id="link250"></a>during many generations. He domineered absolutely over
      the cabinet, and was the favourite at once of the Sovereign, of the
      Parliament, and of the nation. His father had never been so powerful, nor
      Walpole, nor Marlborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      This narrative has now reached a point, beyond which a full history of the
      life of Pitt would be a history of England, or rather of the whole
      civilised world; and for such a history this is not the proper place. Here
      a very slight sketch must suffice; and in that sketch prominence will be
      given to such points as may enable a reader who is already acquainted with
      the general course of events to form a just notion of the character of the
      man on whom so much depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we wish to arrive at a correct judgment of Pitt&rsquo;s merits and defects,
      we must never forget that he belonged to a peculiar class of statesmen,
      and that he must be tried by a peculiar standard. It is not easy to
      compare him fairly with such men as Ximenes and Sully, Richelieu and
      Oxenstiern, John de Witt and Warren Hastings. The means by which those
      politicians governed great communities were of quite a different kind from
      those which Pitt was under the necessity of employing. Some talents, which
      they never had any opportunity of showing that they possessed, were
      developed in him to an extraordinary degree. In some qualities, on the
      other hand, to which they owe a large part of their fame, he was decidedly
      their inferior. They transacted business in their closets, or at boards
      where a few confidential councillors sate. It was his lot to be born in an
      age and in a country in which parliamentary government was completely
      established; his whole training from infancy was such as fitted him to
      bear a part in parliamentary <span class="pagenum">251</span><a
      name="link251" id="link251"></a>government; and, from the prime of his
      manhood to his death, all the powers of his vigorous mind were almost
      constantly exerted in the work of parliamentary government. He accordingly
      became the greatest master of the whole art of parliamentary government
      that has ever existed, a greater than Montagne or Walpole, a greater than
      his father Chatham or his rival Fox, a greater than either of his
      illustrious successors Canning and Peel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parliamentary government, like every other contrivance of man, has its
      advantages and its disadvantages. On the advantages there is no need to
      dilate. The history of England during the hundred and seventy years which
      have elapsed since the House of Commons became the most powerful body in
      the state, her immense and still growing prosperity, her freedom, her
      tranquillity, her greatness in arts, in sciences, and in arms, her
      maritime ascendency, the marvels of her public credit, her American, her
      African, her Australian, her Asiatic empires, sufficiently prove the
      excellence of her institutions. But those institutions, though excellent,
      are assuredly not perfect. Parliamentary government is government by
      speaking. In such a government, the power of speaking is the most highly
      prized of all the qualities which a politician can possess; and that power
      may exist, in the highest degree, without judgment, without fortitude,
      without skill in reading the characters of men or the signs of the times,
      without any knowledge of the principles of legislation or of political
      economy, and without any skill in diplomacy or in the administration of
      war. Nay, it may well happen that those very intellectual qualities which
      give a peculiar charm to the speeches of a public man may be incompatible
      with the qualities which would <span class="pagenum">252</span><a
      name="link252" id="link252"></a>fit him to meet a pressing emergency with
      promptitude and firmness. It was thus with Charles Townshend. It was thus
      with Windham. It was a privilege to listen to those accomplished and
      ingenious orators. But in a perilous crisis they would have been found far
      inferior in all the qualities of rulers to such a man as Oliver Cromwell,
      who talked nonsense, or as William the Silent, who did not talk at all.
      When parliamentary government is established, a Charles Townshend or a
      Windham will almost always exercise much greater influence than such men
      as the great Protector of England, or as the founder of the Batavian
      commonwealth. In such a government, parliamentary talent, though quite
      distinct from the talents of a good executive or judicial official, will
      be a chief qualification for executive and judicial office. From the Book
      of Dignities a curious list might be made out of Chancellors ignorant of
      the principles of equity, and First Lords of the Admiralty ignorant of the
      principles of navigation, of Colonial ministers who could not repeat the
      names of the Colonies, of Lords of the Treasury who did not know the
      difference between funded and unfunded debt, and of Secretaries of the
      India Board who did not know whether the Mahrattas were Mahometans or
      Hindoos. On these grounds, some persons, incapable of seeing more than one
      side of a question, have pronounced parliamentary government a positive
      evil, and have maintained that the administration would be greatly
      improved if the power, now exercised by a large assembly, were transferred
      to a single person. Men of sense will probably think the remedy very much
      worse than the disease, and will be of opinion that there would be small
      gain in exchanging Charles Townshend <span class="pagenum">253</span><a
      name="link253" id="link253"></a>and Windham for the Prince of the Peace,
      or the poor slave and dog Steenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt was emphatically the man of parliamentary government, the type of his
      class, the minion, the child, the spoiled child, of the House of Commons.
      For the House of Commons he had a hereditary, an infantine love. Through
      his whole boyhood, the House of Commons was never out of his thoughts, or
      out of the thoughts of his instructors. Reciting at his father&rsquo;s knee,
      reading Thucydides and Cicero into English, analysing the great Attic
      speeches on the Embassy and on the Crown, he was constantly in training
      for the conflicts of the House of Commons. He was a distinguished member
      of the House of Commons at twenty-one. The ability which he had displayed
      in the House of Commons made him the most powerful subject in Europe
      before he was twenty-five. It would have been happy for himself and for
      his country if his elevation had been deferred. Eight or ten years, during
      which he would have had leisure and opportunity for reading and
      reflection, for foreign travel, for social intercourse and free exchange
      of thought on equal terms with a great variety of companions, would have
      supplied what, without any fault on his part, was wanting to his powerful
      intellect. He had all the knowledge that he could be expected to have;
      that is to say, all the knowledge that a man can acquire while he is a
      student at Cambridge, and all the knowledge that a man can acquire when he
      is First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. But the
      stock of general information which he brought from college, extraordinary
      for a boy, was far inferior to what Fox possessed, and beggarly when
      compared with the massy, the splendid, the various treasures laid up in
      the large <span class="pagenum">254</span><a name="link254" id="link254"></a>mind
      of Burke. After Pitt became minister, he had no leisure to learn more than
      was necessary for the purposes of the day which was passing over him. What
      was necessary for those purposes such a man could learn with little
      difficulty, he was surrounded by experienced and able public servants, he
      could at any moment command their best assistance. From the stores which
      they produced his vigorous mind rapidly collected the materials for a good
      parliamentary case: and that was enough. Legislation and administration
      were with him secondary matters. To the work of framing statutes, of
      negotiating treaties, of organising fleets and armies, of sending forth
      expeditions, he gave only the leavings of his time and the dregs of his
      fine intellect. The strength and sap of his mind were all drawn in a
      different direction. It was when the House of Commons was to be convinced
      and persuaded that he put forth all his powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those powers we must form our estimate chiefly from tradition; for of
      all the eminent speakers of the last age Pitt has suffered most from the
      reporters. Even while he was still living, critics remarked that his
      eloquence could not be preserved, that he must be heard to be appreciated.
      They more than once applied to him the sentence in which Tacitus describes
      the fate of a senator whose rhetoric was admired in the Augustan age:
      &ldquo;Haterii canorum illud et profluens cum ipso simul exstinctum est.&rdquo; There
      is, however, abundant evidence that nature had bestowed on Pitt the
      talents of a great orator; and those talents had been developed in a very
      peculiar manner, first by his education, and secondly by the high official
      position to which he rose early, and in which he passed the greater part
      of his public life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <span class="pagenum">255</span><a name="link255" id="link255"></a>his
      first appearance in Parliament he showed himself superior to all his
      contemporaries in command of language. He could pour forth a long
      succession of round and stately periods, without premeditation, without
      ever pausing for a word, without ever repeating a word, in a voice of
      silver clearness, and with a pronunciation so articulate that not a letter
      was slurred over. He had less amplitude of mind and less richness of
      imagination than Burke, less ingenuity than Windham, less wit than
      Sheridan, less perfect mastery of dialectical fence, and less of that
      highest sort of eloquence which consists of reason and passion fused
      together, than Fox. Yet the almost unanimous judgment of those who were in
      the habit of listening to that remarkable race of men placed Pitt, as a
      speaker, above Burke, above Windham, above Sheridan, and not below Fox.
      His declamation was copious, polished, and splendid. In power of sarcasm
      he was probably not surpassed by any speaker, ancient or modern; and of
      this formidable weapon he made merciless use. In two parts of the
      oratorical art which are of the highest value to a minister of state he
      was singularly expert. No man knew better how to be luminous or how to be
      obscure. When he wished to be understood, he never failed to make himself
      understood. He could with ease present to his audience, not perhaps an
      exact or profound, but a clear, popular, and plausible view of the most
      extensive and complicated subject. Nothing was out of place; nothing was
      forgotten; minute details, dates, sums of money, were all faithfully
      preserved in his memory. Even intricate questions of finance, when
      explained by him, seemed clear to the plainest man among his hearers. On
      the other hand, when he did not wish to be explicit,&mdash;and <span
      class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256" id="link256"></a>no man who is
      at the head of affairs always wishes to be explicit,&mdash;he had a
      marvellous power of saying nothing in language which left on his audience
      the impression that he had said a great deal. He was at once the only man
      who could open a budget without notes, and the only man who, as Windham
      said, could speak that most elaborately evasive and unmeaning of human
      compositions, a King&rsquo;s speech, without premeditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of oratory will always to a great extent depend on the
      character of the orator. There perhaps never were two speakers whose
      eloquence had more of what may be called the race, more of the flavour
      imparted by moral qualities, than Fox and Pitt. The speeches of Fox owe a
      great part of their charm to that warmth and softness of heart, that
      sympathy with human suffering, that admiration for everything great and
      beautiful, and that hatred of cruelty and injustice, which interest and
      delight us even in the most defective reports. No person, on the other
      hand, could hear Pitt without perceiving him to be a man of high,
      intrepid, and commanding spirit, proudly conscious of his own rectitude
      and of his own intellectual superiority, incapable of the low vices of
      fear and envy, but too prone to feel and to show disdain. Pride, indeed,
      pervaded the whole man, was written in the harsh, rigid lines of his face,
      was marked by the way in which he walked, in which he sate, in which he
      stood, and, above all, in which he bowed. Such pride, of course, inflicted
      many wounds. It may confidently be affirmed that there cannot be found, in
      all the ten thousand invectives written against Fox, a word indicating
      that his demeanour had ever made a single personal enemy. On the other
      hand, several men of note who had been partial <span class="pagenum">257</span><a
      name="link257" id="link257"></a>to Pitt, and who to the last continued to
      approve his public conduct and to support his administration, Cumberland,
      for example, Boswell, and Matthias, were so much irritated by the contempt
      with which he treated them, that they complained in print of their wrongs.
      But his pride, though it made him bitterly disliked by individuals,
      inspired the great body of his followers in Parliament and throughout the
      country with respect and confidence. They took him at his own valuation.
      They saw that his self-esteem was not that of an upstart, who was drunk
      with good luck and with applause, and who, if fortune turned, would sink
      from arrogance into abject humility. It was that of the magnanimous man so
      finely described by Aristotle in the Ethics, of the man who thinks himself
      worthy of great things, being in truth worthy. It sprang from a
      consciousness of great powers and great virtues, and was never so
      conspicuously displayed as in the midst of difficulties and dangers which
      would have unnerved and bowed down any ordinary mind. It was closely
      connected, too, with an ambition which had no mixture of low cupidity.
      There was something noble in the cynical disdain with which the mighty
      minister scattered riches and titles to right and left among those who
      valued them, while he spurned them out of his own way. Poor himself, he
      was surrounded by friends on whom he had bestowed three thousand, six
      thousand, ten thousand a year. Plain Mister himself, he had made more
      lords than any three ministers that had preceded him. The garter, for
      which the first dukes in the kingdom were contending, was repeatedly
      offered to him, and offered in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correctness of his private life added much to the dignity of his
      public character. In the relations of son, brother, <span class="pagenum">258</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a>uncle, master, friend, his conduct was
      exemplary. In the small circle of his intimate associates, he was amiable,
      affectionate, even playful. They loved him sincerely; they regretted him
      long; and they would hardly admit that he who was so kind and gentle with
      them could be stern and haughty with others. He indulged, indeed, somewhat
      too freely in wine, which he had early been directed to take as a
      medicine, and which use had made a necessary of life to him. But it was
      very seldom that any indication of undue excess could be detected in his
      tones or gestures; and, in truth, two bottles of port were little more to
      him than two dishes of tea. He had, when he was first introduced into the
      clubs of Saint James&rsquo;s Street, shown a strong taste for play; but he had
      the prudence and the resolution to stop before this taste had acquired the
      strength of habit. From the passion which generally exercises the most
      tyrannical dominion Over the young he possessed an immunity, which is
      probably to be ascribed partly to his temperament and partly to his
      situation. His constitution was feeble; he was very shy; and he was very
      busy. The strictness of his morals furnished such buffoons as Peter Pindar
      and Captain Morris with an inexhaustible theme for merriment of no very
      delicate kind. But the great body of the middle class of Englishmen could
      not see the joke. They warmly praised the young statesman for commanding
      his passions, and for covering his frailties, if he had frailties, with
      decorous obscurity, and would have been very far indeed from thinking
      better of him if he had vindicated himself from the taunts of his enemies
      by taking under his protection a Nancy Parsons or a Marianne Clark.
    </p>
    <p>
      No part of the immense popularity which Pitt long enjoyed <span
      class="pagenum">259</span><a name="link259" id="link259"></a>is to be
      attributed to the eulogies of wits and poets. It might have been naturally
      expected that a man of genius, of learning, of taste, an orator whose
      diction was often compared to that of Tully, the representative, too, of a
      great university, would have taken a peculiar pleasure in befriending
      eminent writers, to whatever political party they might have belonged. The
      love of literature had induced Augustus to heap benefits on Pompeians,
      Somers to be the protector of nonjurors, Harley to make the fortunes of
      Whigs. But it could not move Pitt to show any favour even to Pittites. He
      was doubtless right in thinking that, in general, poetry, history and
      philosophy ought to be suffered, like calico and cutlery, to find their
      proper price in the market, and that to teach men of letters to look
      habitually to the state for their recompense is bad for the state and bad
      for letters. Assuredly nothing can be more absurd or mischievous than to
      waste the public money in bounties for the purpose of inducing people who
      ought to be weighing out grocery or measuring out drapery to write bad or
      middling books. But, though the sound rule is that authors should be left
      to be remunerated by their readers, there will, in every generation, be a
      few exceptions to this rule. To distinguish these special cases from the
      mass is an employment well worthy of the faculties of a great and
      accomplished ruler; and Pitt would assuredly have had little difficulty in
      finding such eases. While he was in power, the greatest philologist of the
      age, his own contemporary at Cambridge, was reduced to earn a livelihood
      by the lowest literary drudgery, and to spend in writing squibs for the <i>Morning
      Chronicle</i>. years to which we might have owed an all but perfect text
      of the whole tragic and comic drama of Athens. <span class="pagenum">260</span><a
      name="link260" id="link260"></a>The greatest historian of the age, forced
      by poverty to leave his country, completed his immortal work on the shores
      of Lake Leman. The political heterodoxy of Person, and the religious
      heterodoxy of Gibbon, may perhaps be pleaded in defence of the minister by
      whom those eminent men were neglected. But there were other cases in which
      no such excuse could be set up. Scarcely had Pitt obtained possession of
      unbounded power when an aged writer of the highest eminence, who had made
      very little by his writings, and who was sinking into the grave under a
      load of infirmities and sorrows, wanted five or six hundred pounds to
      enable him, during the winter or two which might still remain to him, to
      draw his breath more easily in the soft climate of Italy. Not a farthing
      was to be obtained; and before Christmas the author of the English
      Dictionary and of the Lives of the Poets had gasped his last in the river
      fog and coal smoke of Fleet Street. A few months after the death of
      Johnson appeared the Task, incomparably the best poem that any Englishman
      then living had produced&mdash;a poem, too, which could hardly fail to
      excite in a well constituted mind a feeling of esteem and compassion for
      the poet, a man of genius and virtue, whose means were scanty, and whom
      the most cruel of all the calamities incident to humanity had made
      incapable of supporting himself by vigorous and sustained exertion.
      Nowhere had Chatham been praised with more enthusiasm, or in verse more
      worthy of the subject, than in the Task. The son of Chatham, however,
      contented himself with reading and admiring the book, and left the author
      to starve. The pension which, long after, enabled poor Cowper to close his
      melancholy life, unmolested by duns and bailiffs, was obtained for him by
      the <span class="pagenum">261</span><a name="link261" id="link261"></a>strenuous
      kindness of Lord Spencer. What a contrast between the way in which Pitt
      acted towards Johnson and the way in which Lord Grey acted towards his
      political enemy Scott, when Scott, worn out by misfortune and disease, was
      advised to try the effect of the Italian air! What a contrast between the
      way in which Pitt acted towards Cowper and the way in which Burke, a poor
      man and out of place, acted towards Crabbe! Even Dundas, who made no
      pretensions to literary taste, and was content to be considered as a
      hard-headed and somewhat coarse man of business, was, when compared with
      his eloquent and classically educated friend, a Maecenas or a Leo. Dundas
      made Burns an exciseman, with seventy pounds a year; and this was more
      than Pitt, during his long tenure of power, did for the encouragement of
      letters. Even those who may think that it is, in general, no part of the
      duty of a government to reward literary merit will hardly deny that a
      government, which has much lucrative church preferment in its gift, is
      bound, in distributing that preferment, not to overlook divines whose
      writings have rendered great service to the cause of religion. But it
      seems never to have occurred to Pitt that he lay under any such
      obligation. All the theological works of all the numerous bishops whom he
      made and translated are not, when put together, worth fifty pages of the
      Horæ Paulinæ, of the Natural Theology, or of the View of the Evidences of
      Christianity. But on Paley the all-powerful minister never bestowed the
      smallest benefice. Artists Pitt treated as contemptuously as writers. For
      painting he did simply nothing. Sculptors, who had been selected to
      execute monuments voted by Parliament, had to haunt the ante-chambers of
      the Treasury during many years before <span class="pagenum">262</span><a
      name="link262" id="link262"></a>they could obtain a farthing from him. One
      of them, after vainly soliciting the minister for payment during fourteen
      years, had the courage to present a memorial to the King, and thus
      obtained tardy and ungracious justice. Architects it was absolutely
      necessary to employ; and the worst that could be found seem to have been
      employed. Not a single fine public building of any kind or in any style
      was erected during his long administration. It may be confidently affirmed
      that no ruler whose abilities and attainments would bear any comparison
      with his has ever shown such cold disdain for what is excellent in arts
      and letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first administration lasted seventeen years. That long period is
      divided by a strongly marked line into two almost exactly equal parts. The
      first part ended and the second began in the autumn of 1792. Throughout
      both parts Pitt displayed in the highest degree the talents of a
      parliamentary leader. During the first part he was a fortunate and, in
      many respects, a skilful administrator. With the difficulties which he had
      to encounter during the second part he was altogether incapable of
      contending: but his eloquence and his perfect mastery of the tactics of
      the House of Commons concealed his incapacity from the multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eight years which followed the general election of 1784 were as
      tranquil and prosperous as any eight years in the whole history of
      England. Neighbouring nations which had lately been in arms against her,
      and which had flattered themselves that, in losing her American colonies,
      she had lost a chief source of her wealth and of her power, saw, with
      wonder and vexation, that she was more wealthy and more powerful than
      ever. Her trade increased. Her manufactures flourished. Her exchequer was
      full to overflowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very <span class="pagenum">263</span><a name="link263" id="link263"></a>idle
      apprehensions were generally entertained, that the public debt, though
      much less than a third of the debt which we now bear with ease, would be
      found too heavy for the strength of the nation. Those apprehensions might
      not perhaps have been easily quieted by reason. But Pitt quieted them by a
      juggle. He succeeded in persuading first himself, and then the whole
      nation, his opponents included, that a new sinking fund, which, so far as
      it differed from former sinking funds, differed for the worse, would, by
      virtue of some mysterious power of propagation belonging to money, put
      into the pocket of the public creditor great sums not taken out of the
      pocket of the tax-payer. The country, terrified by a danger which was no
      danger, hailed with delight and boundless confidence a remedy which was no
      remedy. The minister was almost universally extolled as the greatest of
      financiers. Meanwhile both the branches of the House of Bourbon found that
      England was as formidable an antagonist as she had ever been. France had
      formed a plan for reducing Holland to vassalage. But England interposed;
      and France receded. Spain interrupted by violence the trade of our
      merchants with the regions near the Oregon. But England armed; and Spain
      receded. Within the island there was profound tranquillity. The King was,
      for the first time, popular. During the twenty-three years which had
      followed his accession he had not been loved by his subjects. His domestic
      virtues were acknowledged. But it was generally thought that the good
      qualities by which he was distinguished in private life were wanting to
      his political character. As a Sovereign, he was resentful, unforgiving,
      stubborn, cunning. Under his rule the country had sustained cruel
      disgraces and disasters; and <span class="pagenum">264</span><a
      name="link264" id="link264"></a>every one of those disgraces and disasters
      was imputed to his strong antipathies, and to his perverse obstinacy in
      the wrong. One statesman after another complained that he had been induced
      by royal caresses, entreaties, and promises, to undertake the direction of
      affairs at a difficult conjuncture, and that, as soon as he had, not
      without sullying his fame and alienating his best friends, served the turn
      for which he was wanted, his ungrateful master began to intrigue against
      him, and to canvass against him. Grenville, Rockingham, Chatham, men of
      widely different characters, but all three upright and high-spirited,
      agreed in thinking that the Prince under whom they had successively held
      the highest place in the government was one of the most insincere of
      mankind. His confidence was reposed, they said, not in those known and
      responsible counsellors to whom he had delivered the seals of office, but
      in secret advisers who stole up the back stairs into his closet. In
      Parliament, his ministers, while defending themselves against the attacks
      of the opposition in front, were perpetually, at his instigation, assailed
      on the flank or in the rear by a vile band of mercenaries who called
      themselves his friends. These men constantly, while in possession of
      lucrative places in his service, spoke and voted against bills which he
      had authorised the First Lord of the Treasury or the Secretary of State to
      bring in. But from the day on which Pitt was placed at the head of affairs
      there was an end of secret influence. His haughty and aspiring spirit was
      not to be satisfied with the mere show of power. Any attempt to undermine
      him at Court, any mutinous movement among his followers in the House of
      Commons, was certain to be at once put down. He had only to tender his
      resignation; and he could dictate <span class="pagenum">265</span><a
      name="link265" id="link265"></a>his own terms. For he, and he alone, stood
      between the Ivinp; and the Coalition. He was therefore little less than
      Mayor of the Palace. The nation loudly applauded the King for having the
      wisdom to repose entire confidence in so excellent a minister. His
      Majesty&rsquo;s private virtues now began to produce their full effect. He was
      generally regarded as the model of a respectable country gentleman,
      honest, good-natured, sober, religious. He rose early: he dined
      temperately: he was strictly faithful to his wife: he never missed church;
      and at church he never missed a response. His people heartily prayed that
      he might long reign over them; and they prayed the more heartily because
      his virtues were set off to the best advantage by the vices and follies of
      the Prince of Wales, who lived in close intimacy with the chiefs of the
      opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strong this feeling was in the public mind appeared signally on one
      great occasion. In the autumn of 1788 the King became insane. The
      opposition, eager for office, committed the great indiscretion of
      asserting that the heir apparent had, by the fundamental laws of England,
      a right to be Regent with the full powers of royalty. Pitt, on the other
      hand, maintained it to be the constitutional doctrine that, when a
      Sovereign is, by reason of infancy, disease, or absence, incapable of
      exercising the regal functions, it belongs to the estates of the realm to
      determine who shall be the vicegerent, and with what portion of the
      executive authority such vicegerent shall be entrusted. A long and violent
      contest followed, in which Pitt was supported by the great body of the
      people with as much enthusiasm as during the first months of his
      administration. Tories with one voice applauded him for <span
      class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266" id="link266"></a>defending the
      sick-bed of a virtuous and unhappy Sovereign against a disloyal faction
      and an undutiful son. Not a few Whigs applauded him for asserting the
      authority of Parliaments and the principles of the Revolution, in
      opposition to a doctrine which seemed to have too much affinity with the
      servile theory of indefeasible hereditary right. The middle class, always
      zealous on the side of decency and the domestic virtues, looked forward
      with dismay to a reign resembling that of Charles II. The palace, which
      had now been, during thirty years, the pattern of an English home, would
      be a public nuisance, a school of profligacy. To the good King&rsquo;s repast of
      mutton and lemonade, despatched at three o&rsquo;clock, would succeed midnight
      banquets, from which the guests would be carried home speechless. To the
      backgammon board at which the good King played for a little silver with
      his equerries, would succeed faro tables from which young patricians who
      had sate down rich would rise up beggars. The drawing-room, from which the
      frown of the Queen had repelled a whole generation of frail beauties,
      would now be again what it had been in the days of Barbara Palmer and
      Louisa de Querouaille. Nay, severely as the public reprobated the Prince&rsquo;s
      many illicit attachments, his one virtuous attachment was reprobated more
      severely still. Even in grave and pious circles his Protestant mistresses
      gave less scandal than his Popish wife. That he must be Regent nobody
      ventured to deny. But he and his friends were so unpopular that Pitt
      could, with general approbation, propose to limit the powers of the Regent
      by restrictions to which it would have been impossible to subject a Prince
      beloved and trusted by the country. Some interested men, fully expecting a
      change of administration, went over <span class="pagenum">267</span><a
      name="link267" id="link267"></a>to the opposition. But the majority,
      purified by these desertions, closed its ranks, and presented a more firm
      array than ever to the enemy. In every division Pitt was victorious. When
      at length, after a stormy interregnum of three months, it was announced,
      on the very eve of the inauguration of the Regent, that the King was
      himself again, the nation was wild with delight. On the evening of the day
      on which His Majesty resumed his functions, a spontaneous illumination,
      the most general that had ever been seen in England, brightened the whole
      vast space from Highgate to Tooting, and from Hammersmith to Greenwich. On
      the day on which he returned thanks in the cathedral of his capital, all
      the horses and carriages within a hundred miles of London were too few for
      the multitudes which flocked to see him pass through the streets. A second
      illumination followed, which was even superior to the first in
      magnificence. Pitt with difficulty escaped from the tumultuous kindness of
      an innumerable multitude which insisted on drawing his coach from Saint
      Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard to Downing Street. This was the moment at which his fame
      and fortune may be said to have reached the zenith. His influence in the
      closet was as great as that of Carr or Milliers had been. His dominion
      over the Parliament was more absolute than that of Walpole or Pelham had
      been. He was at the same time as high in the favour of the populace as
      ever Wilkes or Sacheverell had been. Nothing did more to raise his
      character than his noble poverty. It was well known that, if he had been
      dismissed from office after more than five years of boundless power, he
      would hardly have carried out with him a sum sufficient to furnish the set
      of chambers in which, as he cheerfully declared, he meant to resume the
      <span class="pagenum">268</span><a name="link268" id="link268"></a>practice
      of the law. His admirers, however, were by no means disposed to suffer him
      to depend on daily toil for his daily bread. The voluntary contributions
      which were awaiting his acceptance in the city of London alone would have
      sufficed to make him a rich man. But it may be doubted whether his haughty
      spirit would have stooped to accept a provision so honourably earned and
      so honourably bestowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such a height of power and glory had this extraordinary man risen at
      twenty-nine years of age. And now the tide was on the turn. Only ten davs
      after the triumphant procession to Saint Paul&rsquo;s, the States-General of
      France, after an interval of a hundred and seventy-four years, met at
      Versailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of the great Revolution which followed was long very
      imperfectly understood in this country. Burke saw much further than any of
      his contemporaries: but whatever his sagacity descried was refracted and
      discoloured by his passions and his imagination. More than three years
      elapsed before the principles of the English administration underwent any
      material change. Nothing could as yet be milder or more strictly
      constitutional than the minister&rsquo;s domestic policy. Not a single act
      indicating an arbitrary temper or a jealousy of the people could be
      imputed to him. He had never applied to Parliament for any extraordinary
      powers. He had never used with harshness the ordinary powers entrusted by
      the constitution to the executive government. Not a single state
      prosecution which would even now be called oppressive had been instituted
      by him. Indeed, the only oppressive state prosecution instituted during
      the first eight years of his administration was that of Stockdale, which
      is to be attributed, not to the government, but to the chiefs of <span
      class="pagenum">269</span><a name="link269" id="link269"></a>the
      opposition. In office, Pitt had redeemed the pledges which he had, at his
      entrance into public life, given to the supporters of parliamentary
      reform. He had, in 1785, brought forward a judicious plan for the
      improvement of the representative system, and had prevailed on the King,
      not only to refrain from talking against that plan, but to recommend it to
      the Houses in a speech from the throne. (1) This attempt failed; but there
      can be little doubt that, if the French Revolution had not produced a
      violent reaction of public feeling, Pitt would have performed, with little
      difficulty and no danger, that great work which, at a later period, Lord
      Grey could accomplish only by means which for a time loosened the very
      foundations of the commonwealth. When the atrocities of the slave trade
      were first brought under the consideration of Parliament, no abolitionist
      was more zealous than Pitt. When sickness prevented Wilberforce from
      appearing in public, his place was most efficiently supplied by his friend
      the minister. A humane bill, which mitigated the horrors of the middle
      passage, was, in 1788, carried by the eloquence and determined spirit of
      Pitt, in spite of the opposition of some of his own colleagues; and it
      ought always to be remembered to his honour that, in order to carry that
      bill, he kept the Houses sitting, in spite of many murmurs, long after the
      business of the government had been done, and the Appropriation Act
      passed. In 1791 he cordially concurred with Fox in maintaining the sound
      constitutional doctrine, that an impeachment is not terminated by a

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) The speech with which the King opened the session of
     1785, concluded with an assurance that His Majesty would
     heartily concur in every measure which could tend to secure
     the true principles of the constitution. These words were at
     the time understood to refer to Pitt&rsquo;s Reform Bill.

    <p>
      dissolution. <span class="pagenum">270</span><a name="link270" id="link270"></a>In
      the course of the some year the two great rivals contended side by side in
      a far more important cause. They are fairly entitled to divide the high
      honour of having added to our statute-book the inestimable law which
      places the liberty of the press under the protection of juries. On one
      occasion, and one alone, Pitt, during the first half of his long
      administration, acted in a manner unworthy of an enlightened Whig. In the
      debate on the Test Act, he stooped to gratify the master whom he served,
      the university which he represented, and the great body of clergymen and
      country gentlemen on whose support he rested, by talking, with little
      heartiness, indeed, and with no asperity, the language of a Tory. With
      this single exception, his conduct from the end of 1783 to the middle of
      1792 was that of an honest friend of civil and religious liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did anything, during that period, indicate that he loved war, or
      harboured any malevolent feeling against any neighbouring nation. Those
      French writers who have represented him as a Hannibal sworn in childhood
      by his father to bear eternal hatred to France, as having, by mysterious
      intrigues and lavish bribes, instigated the leading Jacobins to commit
      those excesses which dishonoured the Revolution, as having been the real
      author of the first coalition, know nothing of his character or of his
      history. So far was he from being a deadly enemy to France, that his
      laudable attempts to bring about a closer connection with that country by
      means of a wise and liberal treaty of commerce brought on him the severe
      censure of the opposition. He was told in the House of Commons that he was
      a degenerate son, and that his partiality, for the hereditary foes of our
      island was enough to make his <span class="pagenum">271</span><a
      name="link271" id="link271"></a>great father&rsquo;s hones stir under the
      pavement of the Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this man, whose name, if he had been so fortunate as to die in 1792,
      would now have been associated with peace, with freedom, with
      philanthropy, with temperate reform, with mild and constitutional
      administration, lived to associate his name with arbitrary government,
      with harsh laws harshly executed, with alien bills, with gagging bills,
      with suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act, with cruel punishments
      inflicted on some political agitators, with unjustifiable prosecutions
      instituted against others, and with the most costly and most sanguinary
      wars of modern times. He lived to be held up to obloquy as the stern
      oppressor of England, and the indefatigable disturber of Europe. Poets,
      contrasting his earlier with his later years, likened him sometimes to the
      apostle who kissed in order to betray, and sometimes to the evil angels
      who kept not their first estate. A satirist of great genius introduced the
      fiends of Famine, Slaughter, and Fire, proclaiming that they had received
      their commission from One whose name was formed of four letters, and
      promising to give their employer ample proofs of gratitude. Famine would
      gnaw the multitude till they should rise up against him in madness. The
      demon of Slaughter would impel them to tear him from limb to limb. But
      Fire boasted that she alone could reward him as he deserved, and that she
      would cling round him to all eternity. By the French press and the French
      tribune every crime that disgraced and every calamity that afflicted
      France was ascribed to the monster Pitt and his guineas. While the
      Jacobins were dominant, it was he who had corrupted the Gironde, who had
      raised Lyons and Bordeaux against the Convention, who <span class="pagenum">272</span><a
      name="link272" id="link272"></a>had suborned Paris to assassinate
      Lepelletier, and Cecilia Régnault to assassinate Robespierre. When the
      Thermidorian reaction came, all the atrocities of the Reign of Terror were
      imputed to him. Cullot D&rsquo;Herbois and Fouquier Tinville had been his
      pensioners. It was he who had hired the murderers of September, who had
      dictated the pamphlets of Marat and the Carmagnoles of Barrere, who had
      paid Lebon to deluge Arras with blood, and Carrier to choice the Loire
      with corpses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, that he liked neither war nor arbitrary government. He was a
      lover of peace and freedom, driven, by a stress against which it was
      hardly possible for any will or any intellect to struggle, out of the
      course to which his inclinations pointed, and for which his abilities and
      acquirements fitted him, and forced into a policy repugnant to his
      feelings and unsuited to his talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charge of apostasy is grossly unjust. A man ought no more to be called
      an apostate because his opinions alter with the opinions of the great body
      of his contemporaries than he ought to be called an oriental traveller
      because he is always going round from west to east with the globe and
      everything that is upon it. Between the spring of 1789 and the close of
      1792, the public mind of England underwent a great change. If the change
      of Pitt&rsquo;s sentiments attracted peculiar notice, it was not because he
      changed more than his neighbours; for in fact he changed less than most of
      them; but because his position was far more conspicuous than theirs;
      because he was, till Bonaparte appeared, the individual who filled the
      greatest space in the eyes of the inhabitants of the civilised world.
      During a short time the nation, and Pitt, as one of the <span
      class="pagenum">273</span><a name="link273" id="link273"></a>nation,
      looked with interest and approbation on the French Revolution. But soon
      vast confiscations, the violent sweeping away of ancient institutions, the
      domination of clubs, the barbarities of mobs maddened by famine and
      hatred, produced a reaction here. The court, the nobility, the gentry, the
      clergy, the manufacturers, the merchants, in short, nineteen twentieths of
      those who had good roofs over their heads and good coats on their backs,
      became eager and intolerant Antijacobins. This feeling was at least as
      strong among the minister&rsquo;s adversaries as among his supporters. Fox in
      vain attempted to restrain his followers. All his genius, all his vast
      personal influence, could not prevent them from rising up against him in
      general mutiny. Burke set the example of revolt; and Burke was in no long
      time joined by Portland, Spencer, Fitz-william, Loughborough, Carlisle,
      Malmesbury, Windham, Elliot. In the House of Commons, the followers of the
      great Whig statesman and orator diminished from about a hundred and sixty
      to fifty. In the House of Lords he had but ten or twelve adherents left.
      There can be no doubt that there would have been a similar mutiny on the
      ministerial benches if Pitt had obstinately resisted the general wish.
      Pressed at once by his master and by his colleagues, by old friends and by
      old opponents, he abandoned, slowly and reluctantly, the policy which was
      dear to his heart. He laboured hard to avert the European war. When the
      European war broke out, he still flattered himself that it would not be
      necessary for this country to take either side. In the spring of 1792 he
      congratulated the Parliament on the prospect of long and profound peace,
      and proved his sincerity by proposing large remissions of taxation. Down
      to the end of that year he <span class="pagenum">274</span><a
      name="link274" id="link274"></a>continued to cherish the hope that England
      might be able to preserve neutrality. But the passions which raged on both
      sides of the Channel were not to be restrained. The republicans who ruled
      France were inflamed by a fanaticism resembling that of the Mussulmans,
      who, with the Koran in one hand and the sword in the other, went forth,
      conquering and converting, eastward to the Bay of Bengal, and westward to
      the Pillars of Hercules. The higher and middle classes of England were
      animated by zeal not less fiery than that of the Crusaders who raised the
      cry of <i>Deus vult</i> at Clermont. The impulse which drove the two
      nations to a collision was not to be arrested by the abilities or by the
      authority of any single man. As Pitt was in front of his fellows, and
      towered high above them, he seemed to lead them. But in fact he was
      violently pushed on by them, and, had he held back but a little more than
      he did, would have been thrust out of their way or trampled under their
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He yielded to the current: and from that day his misfortunes began. The
      truth is that there were only two consistent courses before him. Since he
      did not choose to oppose himself, side by side with Fox, to the public
      feeling, he should have taken the advice of Burke, and should have availed
      himself of that feeling to the full extent. If it was impossible to
      preserve peace, he should have adopted the only policy which could lead to
      victory. He should have proclaimed a Holy War for religion, morality,
      property, order, public law, and should have thus opposed to the Jacobins
      an energy equal to their own. Unhappily he tried to find a middle path;
      and he found one which united all that was worst in both extremes. He went
      to war: but he would not understand the peculiar character of that <span
      class="pagenum">275</span><a name="link275" id="link275"></a>war. He was
      obstinately blind to the plain fact, that he was contending; against a
      state which was also a sect, and that the new quarrel between England and
      France was of quite a different kind from the old quarrels about colonies
      in America and fortresses in the Netherlands. He had to combat frantic
      enthusiasm, boundless ambition, restless activity, the wildest and most
      audacious spirit of innovation; and he acted as if he had to deal with the
      harlots and fops of the old Court of Versailles, with Madame de Pompadour
      and the Abbé de Bernis. It was pitiable to hear him, year after year,
      proving to an admiring audience that the wicked Republic was exhausted,
      that she could not hold out, that her credit was gone, and her assignats
      were not worth more than the paper of which they were made; as if credit
      was necessary to a government of which the principle was rapine, as if
      Alboin could not turn Italy into a desert till he had negotiated a loan at
      five per cent., as if the exchequer bills of Attila had been at par. It
      was impossible that a man who so completely mistook the nature of a
      contest could carry on that contest successfully. Great as Pitt&rsquo;s
      abilities were, his military administration was that of a driveller. He
      was at the head of a nation engaged in a struggle for life and death, of a
      nation eminently distinguished by all the physical and all the moral
      qualities which make excellent soldiers. The resources at his command were
      unlimited. The Parliament was even more ready to grant him men and money
      than he was to ask for them. In such an emergency, and with such means,
      such a statesman as Richelieu, as Louvois, as Chatham, as Wellesley, would
      have created in a few months one of the finest armies in the world, and
      would soon have discovered and <span class="pagenum">276</span><a
      name="link276" id="link276"></a>brought forward generals worthy to command
      such an army. Germany might have been saved by another Blenheim; Flanders
      recovered by another Families; another Poitiers might have delivered the
      Royalist and Catholic provinces of France from a yoke which they abhorred,
      and might have spread terror even to the barriers of Paris. But the fact
      is, that, after eight years of war, after a vast destruction of life,
      after an expenditure of wealth far exceeding the expenditure of the
      American war, of the Seven Years&rsquo; War, of the war of the Austrian
      Succession, and of the war of the Spanish Succession, united, the English
      army, under Pitt, was the laughing-stock of all Europe. It could not boast
      of one single brilliant exploit. It had never shown itself on the
      Continent but to be beaten, chased, forced to reëmbark, or forced to
      capitulate. To take some sugar island in the West Indies, to scatter some
      mob of half-naked Irish peasants, such were the most splendid victories
      won by the British troops under Pitt&rsquo;s auspices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English navy no mismanagement could ruin. But during a long period
      whatever mismanagement could do was done. The Earl of Chatham, without a
      single qualification for high public trust, was made, by fraternal
      partiality, First Lord of the Admiralty, and was kept in that great post
      during two years of a war in which the very existence of the state
      depended on the efficiency of the fleet. He continued to doze away and
      trifle away the time which ought to have been do-voted to the public
      service, till the whole mercantile body, though generally disposed to
      support the government, complained bitterly that our flag gave no
      protection to our trade. Fortunately he was succeeded by George Earl
      Spencer, one of those chiefs of the Whig party <span class="pagenum">277</span><a
      name="link277" id="link277"></a>who, in the great schism caused by the
      French Revolution, had followed Burke. Lord Spencer, though inferior to
      many of his colleagues as an orator, was decidedly the best administrator
      among them. To him it was owing that a long and gloomy succession of days
      of fasting, and, most emphatically, of humiliation, was interrupted, twice
      in the short space of eleven months, by days of thanksgiving for great
      victories.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem paradoxical to say that the incapacity which Pitt showed in
      all that related to the conduct of the war is, in some sense, the most
      decisive proof that he was a man of very extraordinary abilities. Yet this
      is the simple truth. For assuredly one-tenth part of his errors and
      disasters would have been fatal to the power and influence of any minister
      who had not possessed, in the highest degree, the talents of a
      parliamentary leader. While his schemes were confounded, while his
      predictions were falsified, while the coalitions which he had laboured to
      form were falling to pieces, while the expeditions which he had sent forth
      at enormous cost were ending in rout and disgrace, while the enemy against
      whom he was feebly contending was subjugating Flanders and Brabant, the
      Electorate of Mentz, and the Electorate of Treves, Holland, Piedmont,
      Liguria, Lombardy, his authority over the House of Commons was constantly
      becoming more and more absolute. There was his empire. There were his
      victories, his Lodi and his Areola, his Rivoli and his Marengo. If some
      great misfortune, a pitched battle lost by the allies, the annexation of a
      new department to the French Republic, a sanguinary insurrection in
      Ireland, a mutiny in the fleet, a panic in the city, a run on the bank,
      had spread dismay through the ranks of his majority, that dismay lasted
      only till he rose from the Treasury <span class="pagenum">278</span><a
      name="link278" id="link278"></a>bench, drew up his haughty head, stretched
      his arm with commanding gesture, and poured forth, in deep and sonorous
      tones, the lofty language of inextinguishable hope and inflexible
      resolution. Thus, through a long and calamitous period, every disaster
      that happened without the walls of Parliament was regularly followed by a
      triumph within them. At length he had no longer an opposition to
      encounter. Of the great party which had contended against him during the
      first eight years of his administration more than one half now marched
      under his standard, with his old competitor the Duke of Portland at their
      head; and the rest had, after many vain struggles, quitted the field in
      despair. Fox had retired to the shades of St. Anne&rsquo;s Hill, and had there
      found, in the society of friends whom no vicissitude could estrange from
      him, of a woman whom he tenderly loved, and of the illustrious dead of
      Athens, of Home, and of Florence, ample compensation for all the
      misfortunes of his public life. Session followed session with scarcely a
      single division. In the eventful year 1799, the largest minority that
      could be mustered against the government was twenty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Pitt&rsquo;s domestic policy there was at this time assuredly no want of
      vigour. While he offered to French Jacobinism a resistance so feeble that
      it only encouraged the evil which he wished to suppress, he put down
      English Jacobinism with a strong hand. The Habeas Corpus Act was
      repeatedly suspended. Public meetings were placed under severe restraints.
      The government obtained from Parliament power to send out of the country
      aliens who were suspected of evil designs; and that power was not suffered
      to be idle. Writers who propounded doctrines adverse to monarchy <span
      class="pagenum">279</span><a name="link279" id="link279"></a>and
      aristocracy were proscribed and punished without mercy. It was hardly safe
      for a republican to avow his political creed over his beefsteak and his
      bottle of port at a chop-house. The old laws of Scotland against sedition,
      laws which were considered by Englishmen as barbarous, and which a
      succession of governments had suffered to rust, were now furbished up and
      sharpened anew. Men of cultivated minds and polished manners were, for
      offences which at Westminster would have been treated as mere
      misdemeanours, sent to herd with felons at Botany Bay. Some reformers,
      whose opinions were extravagant, and whose language was intemperate, but
      who had never dreamed of subverting the government by physical force, were
      indicted for high treason, and were saved from the gallows only by the
      righteous verdicts of juries. This severity was at the time loudly
      applauded by alarmists whom fear, had made cruel, but will be seen in a
      very different light by posterity. The truth is, that the Englishmen who
      wished for a revolution were, even in number, not formidable, and, in
      every thing but number, a faction utterly contemptible, without arms, or
      funds, or plans, or organisation, or leader. There can be no doubt that
      Pitt, strong as he was in the support of the great body of the nation,
      might easily have repressed the turbulence of the discontented minority by
      firmly yet temperately enforcing the ordinary law. Whatever vigour he
      showed during this unfortunate part of his life was vigour out of place
      and season. He was all feebleness and languor in his conflict with the
      foreign enemy who was really to be dreaded, and reserved all his energy
      and resolution for the domestic enemy who might safely have been despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      One part only of Pitt&rsquo;s conduct during the last eight years <span
      class="pagenum">280</span><a name="link280" id="link280"></a>of the
      eighteenth century deserves high praise, he was the first English minister
      who formed great designs for the benefit of Ireland. The manner in which
      the Roman Catholic population of that unfortunate country had been kept
      down during many generations seemed to him unjust and cruel; and it was
      scarcely possible for a man of his abilities not to perceive that, in a
      contest against the Jacobins, the Roman Catholics were his natural allies.
      Had he been able to do all that he wished, it is probable that a wise and
      liberal policy would have averted the rebellion of 1708. But the
      difficulties which he encountered were great, perhaps insurmountable; and
      the Roman Catholics were, rather by his misfortune than by his fault,
      thrown into the hands of the Jacobins. There was a third great rising of
      the Irishry against the Englishry, a rising not less formidable than the
      risings of 1641 and 1689. The Englishry remained victorious; and it was
      necessary for Pitt, as it had been necessary for Oliver Cromwell and
      William of Orange before him, to consider how the victory should be used.
      It is only just to his memory to say that he formed a scheme of policy, so
      grand and so simple, so righteous and so humane, that it would alone
      entitle him to a high place among statesmen. He determined to make Ireland
      one kingdom with England, and, at the same time, to relieve the Roman
      Catholic laity from civil disabilities, and to grant a public maintenance
      to the Roman Catholic clergy. Had he been able to carry these noble
      designs into effect, the Union would have been an Union indeed. It would
      have been inseparably associated in the minds of the great majority of
      Irishmen with civil and religious freedom; and the old Parliament in
      College Green would have been regretted only <span class="pagenum">281</span><a
      name="link281" id="link281"></a>by a small knot of discarded jobbers and
      oppressors, and would have been remembered by the body of the nation with
      the loathing and contempt due to the most tyrannical and the most corrupt
      assembly that had ever sate in Europe. But Pitt could execute only one
      half of what he had projected. He succeeded in obtaining the consent of
      the Parliaments of both kingdoms to the Union; but that reconciliation of
      races and sects, without which the Union could exist only in name, was not
      accomplished. He was well aware that he was likely to find difficulties in
      the closet. But he flattered himself that, by cautious and dexterous
      management, those difficulties might be overcome. Unhappily, there were
      traitors and sycophants in high place who did not suffer him to take his
      own time and his own way, but prematurely disclosed his scheme to the
      King, and disclosed it in the manner most likely to irritate and alarm a
      weak and diseased mind. His Majesty absurdly imagined that his Coronation
      oath bound him to refuse his assent to any bill for relieving Roman
      Catholics from civil disabilities. To argue with him was impossible.
      Dundas tried to explain the matter, but was told to keep his Scotch
      metaphysics to himself. Pitt, and Pitt&rsquo;s ablest colleagues, resigned their
      offices. It was necessary that the King should make a new arrangement. But
      by this time his anger and distress had brought back the malady which had,
      many years before, incapacitated him for the discharge of his functions.
      He actually assembled his family, read the Coronation oath to them, and
      told them that, if he broke it, the Crown would immediately pass to the
      House of Savoy. It was not until after an interregnum of several weeks
      that he regained the full use of his small faculties, and that <span
      class="pagenum">282</span><a name="link282" id="link282"></a>a ministry
      after his own heart was at length formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The materials out of which he had to construct a government were neither
      solid nor splendid. To that party, weak in numbers, but strong in every
      kind of talent, which was hostile to the domestic and foreign policy of
      his late advisers, he could not have recourse. For that party, while it
      differed from his late advisers on every point on which they had been
      honoured with his approbation, cordially agreed with them as to the single
      matter which had brought on them his displeasure. All that was left to him
      was to call up the rear ranks of the old ministry to form the front rank
      of a new ministry. In an age pre-eminently fruitful of parliamentary
      talents, a cabinet was formed containing hardly a single man who, in
      parliamentary talents, could be considered as even of the second rate. The
      most important offices in the state were bestowed on decorous and
      laborious mediocrity. Henry Addington was at the head of the Treasury. He
      had been an early, indeed a hereditary, friend of Pitt, and had by Pitt&rsquo;s
      influence been placed, while still a young man, in the chair of the House
      of Commons. He was universally admitted to have been the best speaker that
      had sate in that chair since the retirement of Onslow. But nature had not
      bestowed on him very vigorous faculties; and the highly respectable
      situation which he had long occupied with honour had rather unfitted than
      fitted him for the discharge of his new duties. His business had been to
      bear himself evenly between contending factions. He had taken no part in
      the war of words; and he had always been addressed with marked deference
      by the great orators who thundered against each other from his right and
      from his left. It was <span class="pagenum">283</span><a name="link283"
       id="link283"></a>not strange that, when, for the first time, he had to
      encounter keen and vigorous antagonists, who dealt hard blows without the
      smallest ceremony, he should have been awkward and unready, or, that the
      air of dignity and authority which he had acquired in his former post, and
      of which he had not divested himself, should have made his helplessness
      laughable and pitiable. Nevertheless, during many months, his power seemed
      to stand firm. He was a favourite with the King, whom he resembled in
      narrowness of mind, and to whom he was more obsequious than Pitt had ever
      been. The nation was put into high good humour by a peace with France. The
      enthusiasm with which the upper and middle, classes had rushed into the
      war spent itself. Jacobinism was no longer formidable. Everywhere there
      was a strong reaction against what was called the atheistical and
      anarchical philosophy of the eighteenth century. Bonaparte, now First
      Consul, was busied in constructing out of the ruins of old institutions a
      new ecclesiastical establishment and a new order of knighthood. That
      nothing less than the dominion of the whole civilised world would satisfy
      his selfish ambition was not yet suspected; nor did even wise men see any
      reason to doubt that he might be as safe a neighbour as any prince of the
      House of Bourbon had been. The treaty of Amiens was therefore hailed by
      the great body of the English people with extravagant joy. The popularity
      of the minister was for the moment immense. His want of parliamentary
      ability was, as yet, of little consequence; for he had scarcely any
      adversary to encounter. The old opposition, delighted by the peace,
      regarded him with favour. A new opposition had indeed been formed by some
      of the late ministers, <span class="pagenum">284</span><a name="link284"
       id="link284"></a>and was led by Grenville in the House of Lords, and by
      Windham in the House of Commons. But the new opposition could scarcely
      muster ten votes, and was regarded with no favour by the country. On Pitt
      the ministers relied as on their firmest support. He had not, like some of
      his colleagues, retired in anger. He had expressed the greatest respect
      for the conscientious scruple which had taken possession of the royal
      mind; and he had promised his successors all the help in his power. In
      private his advice was at their service. In Parliament he took his seat on
      the bench behind them; and, in more than one debate, defended them with
      powers far superior to their own. The King perfectly understood the value
      of such assistance. On one occasion, at the palace, he took the old
      minister and the new minister aside. &ldquo;If we three,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;keep
      together, all will go well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was hardly possible, human nature being what it is, and, more
      especially, Pitt and Addington being what they were, that this union
      should be durable. Pitt, conscious of superior powers, imagined that the
      place which he had quitted was now occupied by a mere puppet which he had
      set up, which he was to govern while he suffered it to remain, and which
      he was to fling aside as soon as he wished to resume his old position. Nor
      was it long before he began to pine for the power which he had
      relinquished. He had been so early raised to supreme authority in the
      state, and had enjoyed that authority so long, that it had become
      necessary to him. In retirement his days passed heavily. He could not,
      like Fox, forget the pleasures and cares of ambition in the company of
      Euripides or Herodotus. Pride restrained him from intimating, even to his
      dearest friends, that he wished to be again minister. <span class="pagenum">285</span><a
      name="link285" id="link285"></a>But he thought it strange, almost
      ungrateful, that his wish had not been divined, that it had not been
      anticipated, by one whom he regarded as his deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addington, on the other hand, was by no means inclined to descend from his
      high position. He was, indeed, under a delusion much resembling that of
      Abon Hassan in the Arabian tale. His brain was turned by his short and
      unreal Caliphate. He took his elevation quite seriously, attributed it to
      his own merit, and considered himself as one of the great triumvirate of
      English statesmen, as worthy to make a third with Pitt and Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such being the feelings of the late minister and of the present minister,
      a rupture was inevitable; and there was no want of persons bent on making
      that rupture speedy and violent. Some of these persons wounded Addington&rsquo;s
      pride by representing him as a lacquey, sent to keep a place on the
      Treasury bench till his master should find it convenient to come. Others
      took every opportunity of praising him at Pitt&rsquo;s expense. Pitt had waged a
      long, a bloody, a costly, an unsuccessful war. Addington had made peace.
      Pitt had suspended the constitutional liberties of Englishmen. Under
      Addington those liberties were again enjoyed. Pitt had wasted the public
      resources. Addington was carefully nursing them. It was sometimes but too
      evident that these compliments were not unpleasing to Addington. Pitt
      became cold and reserved. During many months he remained at a distance
      from London. Meanwhile his most intimate friends, in spite of his
      declarations that he made no complaint, and that he had no wish for
      office, exerted themselves to effect a change of ministry. His favourite
      disciple, George <span class="pagenum">286</span><a name="link286"
       id="link286"></a>Canning, young, ardent, ambitious, with great powers and
      great virtues, but with a temper too restless and a wit too satirical tor
      his own happiness, was indefatigable. He spoke; he wrote; he intrigued; he
      tried to induce a large number of the supporters of the government to sign
      a round robin desiring a change; he made game of Addington and of
      Addington&rsquo;s relations in a succession of lively pasquinades. The
      minister&rsquo;s partisans retorted with equal acrimony, if not with equal
      vivacity. Pitt could keep out of the affray only by keeping out of
      politics altogether; and this it soon became impossible for him to do. Had
      Napoleon, content with the first place amoung the sovereigns of the
      Continent, and with a military reputation surpassing that of Marlborough
      or of Turenne, devoted himself to the noble task of making France happy by
      mild administration and wise legislation, our country might have long
      continued to tolerate a government of fair intentions and feeble
      abilities. Unhappily, the treaty of Amiens had scarcely been signed, when
      the restless ambition and the insupportable insolence of the First Consul
      convinced the great body of the English people that the peace, so eagerly
      welcomed, was only a precarious armistice. As it became clearer and
      clearer that a war for the dignity, the independence, the very existence
      of the nation was at hand, men looked with increasing uneasiness on the
      weak and languid cabinet which would have to contend against an enemy who
      united more than the power of Lewis the Great to more than the genius of
      Frederick the Great. It is true that Addington might easily have been a
      better war minister than Pitt, and could not possibly have been a worse.
      But Pitt had cast a spell on the public mind. The eloquence, the judgment,
      <span class="pagenum">287</span><a name="link287" id="link287"></a>the
      calm and disdainful firmness, which he had, during many years, displayed
      in Parliament, deluded the world into the belief that he must be eminently
      qualified to superintend every department of politics; and they imagined,
      even after the miserable failures of Dunkirk, of Quiberon, and of the
      Helder, that he was the only statesman who could cope with Bonaparte. This
      feeling was nowhere stronger than among Addington&rsquo;s own colleagues. The
      pressure put on him was so strong that he could not help yielding to it;
      yet, even in yielding, he showed how far he was from knowing his own
      place. His first proposition was, that some insignificant nobleman should
      be First Lord of the Treasury and nominal head of the administration, and
      that the real power should be divided between Pitt and himself, who were
      to be secretaries of state. Pitt, as might have been expected, refused
      even to discuss such a scheme, and talked of it with bitter mirth. &ldquo;Which
      secretaryship was offered to you?&rdquo; his friend Wilberforce asked. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo;
       said Pitt, &ldquo;I had not the curiosity to inquire.&rdquo; Addington was frightened
      into bidding higher. He offered to resign the Treasury to Pitt, on
      condition that there should be no extensive change in the government. But
      Pitt would listen to no such terms. Then came a dispute such as often
      arises after negotiations orally conducted, even when the negotiators are
      men of strict honour. Pitt gave one account of what had passed; Addington
      gave another: and, though the discrepancies were not such as necessarily
      implied any intentional violation of truth on either side, both were
      greatly exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the quarrel with the First Consul had come to a crisis. On the
      16th of May, 1803, the King <span class="pagenum">288</span><a
      name="link288" id="link288"></a>sent a message calling on the House of
      Commons to support him in withstanding the ambitious and encroaching
      policy of France; and, on the 22nd, the House took the message into
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt had now been living many months in retirement. There had been a
      general election since he had spoken in Parliament; and there were two
      hundred members who had never heard him. It was known that on this
      occasion he would be in his place; and curiosity was wound up to the
      highest point. Unfortunately, the short-hand writers were, in consequence
      of some mistake, shut out on that day from the gallery, so that the
      newspapers contained only a very meagre report of the proceedings. But
      several accounts of what passed are extant; and of those accounts the most
      interesting is contained in an unpublished letter, written by a very young
      member, John William Ward, afterwards Earl of Dudley. When Pitt rose, he
      was received with loud cheering. At every pause in his speech there was a
      burst of applause. The peroration is said to have been one of the most
      animated and magnificent ever heard in Parliament. &ldquo;Pitt&rsquo;s speech,&rdquo; Fox
      wrote a few days later, &ldquo;was admired very much, and very justly. I think
      it was the best he ever made in that style.&rdquo; The debate was adjourned; and
      on the second night Fox replied in an oration which, as the most zealous
      Pittites were forced to acknowledge, left the palm of eloquence doubtful.
      Addington made a pitiable appearance between the two great rivals; and it
      was observed that Pitt, while exhorting the Commons to stand resolutely by
      the executive government against France, said not a word indicating esteem
      or friendship for the Prime Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      War <span class="pagenum">289</span><a name="link289" id="link289"></a>was
      speedily declared. The First Consul threatened to invade England at the
      head of the conquerors of Belgium and Italy, and formed a great camp near
      the Straits of Dover. On the other side of those Straits the whole
      population of our island was ready to rise up as one man in defence of the
      soil. At this conjuncture, as at some other great conjunctures in our
      history, the conjuncture of 1660, for example, and the conjuncture of
      1688, there was a general disposition among honest and patriotic men to
      forget old quarrels, and to regard as a friend every person who was ready,
      in the existing emergency, to do his part towards the saving of the state.
      A coalition of all the first, men in the country would, at that moment,
      have been as popular as the coalition of 1783 had been unpopular. Alone in
      the kingdom the King looked with perfect complacency on a cabinet in which
      no man superior to himself in genius was to be found, and was so far from
      being willing to admit all his ablest subjects to office that he was bent
      on excluding them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months passed before the different parties which agreed in regarding
      the government with dislike and contempt came to an understanding with
      each other. But in the spring of 1804 it became evident that the weakest
      of ministries would have to defend itself against the strongest of
      oppositions, an opposition made up of three oppositions, each of which
      would, separately, have been formidable from ability, and which, when
      united, were also formidable from number. The party which had opposed the
      peace, headed by Grenville and Windham, and the party which had opposed
      the renewal of the war, headed by Fox, concurred in thinking that the men
      now in power were <span class="pagenum">290</span><a name="link290"
       id="link290"></a>incapable of either making a good peace or waging a
      vigorous war. Pitt had, in 1802, spoken for peace against the party of
      Grenville, and had, in 1803, spoken for war against the party of Fox. But
      of the capacity of the cabinet, and especially of its chief, for the
      conduct of great affairs, he thought as meanly as either Fox or Grenville.
      Questions were easily found on which all the enemies of the government
      could act cordially together. The unfortunate First Lord of the Treasury,
      who had, during the earlier months of his administration, been supported
      by Pitt on one side, and by Fox on the other, now had to answer Pitt, and
      to be answered by Fox. Two sharp debates, followed by close divisions,
      made him weary of his post. It was known, too, that the Upper House was
      even more hostile to him than the Lower, that the Scotch representative
      peers wavered, that there were signs of mutiny among the bishops. In the
      cabinet itself there was discord, and, worse than discord, treachery. It
      was necessary to giveway: the ministry was dissolved: and the task of
      forming a government was entrusted to Pitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt was of opinion that there was now an opportunity, such as had never
      before offered itself, and such as might never offer itself again, of
      uniting in the public service, on honourable terms, all the eminent
      talents of the kingdom. The passions to which the French Revolution had
      given birth were extinct. The madness of the innovator and the madness of
      the alarmist had alike had their day. Jacobinism and Anti-Jacobinism had
      gone out of fashion together. The most liberal statesman did not think
      that season propitious for schemes of parliamentary reform; and the most
      conservative statesman could not pretend that there was <span
      class="pagenum">291</span><a name="link291" id="link291"></a>any occasion
      for gagging bills and suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act. The great
      struggle for independence and national honour occupied all minds; and
      those who were agreed as to the duty of maintaining that struggle with
      vigour might well postpone to a more convenient time all disputes about
      matters comparatively unimportant. Strongly impressed by these
      considerations, Pitt wished to form a ministry including all the first men
      in the country. The Treasury he reserved for himself; and to Fox he
      proposed to assign a share of power little inferior to his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was excellent; but the king would not hear of it. Dull,
      obstinate, unforgiving, and, at that time, half mad, he positively refused
      to admit Fox into his service. Anybody else, even men who had gone as far
      as Fox, or further than Fox, in what his Majesty considered as Jacobinism,
      Sheridan, Grey, Erskine, should be graciously received; but Fox never.
      During several hours Pitt laboured in vain to reason down this senseless
      antipathy. That he was perfectly sincere there can be no doubt: but it was
      not enough to be sincere; he should have been resolute. Had he declared
      himself determined not to take office without Fox, the royal obstinacy
      would have given way, as it gave way, a few months later, when opposed to
      the immutable resolution of Lord Grenville. In an evil hour Pitt yielded.
      He flattered himself with the hope that, though he consented to forego the
      aid of his illustrious rival, there would still remain ample materials for
      the formation of an efficient ministry. That hope was cruelly
      disappointed. Fox entreated his friends to leave personal considerations
      out of the question, and declared that he would support, with the utmost
      cordiality, an efficient and patriotic ministry from which he <span
      class="pagenum">292</span><a name="link292" id="link292"></a>should be
      himself excluded. Not only his friends, however, but Grenville, and
      Grenville&rsquo;s adherents, answered, with one voice, that the question was not
      personal, that a great constitutional principle was at stake, and that
      they would not take office while a man eminently qualified to render
      service to the commonwealth was placed under a ban merely because he was
      disliked at Court. All that was left to Pitt was to construct a government
      out of the wreck of Addington&rsquo;s feeble administration. The small circle of
      his personal retainers furnished him with a very few useful assistants,
      particularly Dundas, who had been created Viscount Melville, Lord
      Harrowby, and Canning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the inauspicious manner in which Pitt entered on his second
      administration. The whole history of that administration was of a piece
      with the commencement. Almost every month brought some new disaster or
      disgrace. To the war with France was soon added a war with Spain. The
      opponents of the minister were numerous, able, and active. His most useful
      coadjutors he soon lost. Sickness deprived him of the help of Lord
      Harrowby. It was discovered that Lord Melville had been guilty of highly
      culpable laxity in transactions relating to public money. He was censured
      by the House of Commons, driven from office, ejected from the Privy
      Council, and impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours. The blow fell
      heavy on Pitt. It gave him, he said in Parliament, a deep pang; and, as he
      uttered the word pang, his lip quivered, his voice shook, he paused, and
      his hearers thought that he was about to burst into tears. Such tears shed
      by Eldon would have moved nothing but laughter. Shed by the warm-hearted
      and open-hearted Fox, <span class="pagenum">293</span><a name="link293"
       id="link293"></a>they would have moved sympathy, but would have caused no
      surprise. But a tear from Pitt would have been something portentous. He
      suppressed his emotion, however, and proceeded with his usual majestic
      self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      His difficulties compelled him to resort to various expedients. At one
      time Addington was persuaded to accept office with a peerage; but he
      brought no additional strength to the government. Though he went through
      the form of reconciliation, it was impossible for him to forget the past.
      While he remained in place he was jealous and punctilious; and he soon
      retired again. At another time Pitt renewed his efforts to overcome his
      master&rsquo;s aversion to Fox; and it was rumoured that the King&rsquo;s obstinacy
      was gradually giving away. But, meanwhile, it was impossible for the
      minister to conceal from the public eye the decay of his health, and the
      constant anxiety which gnawed at his heart. His sleep was broken. His food
      ceased to nourish him. All who passed him in the Park, all who had
      interviews with him in Downing Street, saw misery written in his face. The
      peculiar look which he wore during the last months of his life was often
      pathetically described by Wilberforce, who used to call it the Austerlitz
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the vigour of Pitt&rsquo;s intellectual faculties, and the intrepid
      haughtiness of his spirit, remained unaltered. He had staked everything on
      a great venture. He had succeeded in forming another mighty coalition
      against the French ascendency. The united forces of Austria, Russia and
      England might, he hoped, oppose an insurmountable barrier to the ambition
      of the common enemy. But the genius and energy of Napoleon prevailed.
      While the English troops were preparing to <span class="pagenum">294</span><a
      name="link294" id="link294"></a>embark for Germany, while the Russian
      troops were slowly coming up from Poland, he, with rapidity unprecedented
      in modern war, moved a hundred thousand men from the shores of the Ocean
      to the Black Forest, and compelled a great Austrian army to surrender at
      Ulm. To the first faint rumours of this calamity Pitt would give no
      credit. He was irritated by the alarms of those around him. &ldquo;Do not
      believe a word of it,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;it is all a fiction.&rdquo; The next day he
      received a Dutch newspaper containing the capitulation. He knew no Dutch.
      It was Sunday; and the public offices were shut. He carried the paper to
      Lord Malmesbury, who had been minister in Holland; and Lord Malmesbury
      translated it. Pitt tried to bear up; but the shock was too great; and he
      went away with death in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of the battle of Trafalgar arrived four days later, and seemed
      for a moment to revive him. Forty-eight hours after that most glorious and
      most mournful of victories had been announced to the country came the Lord
      Mayor&rsquo;s day; and Pitt dined at Guildhall. His popularity had declined. But
      on this occasion the multitude, greatly excited by the recent tidings,
      welcomed him enthusiastically, took off his horses in Cheapside, and drew
      his carriage up King Street. When his health was drunk, he returned thanks
      in two or three of those stately sentences of which he had a boundless
      command. Several of those who heard him laid up his words in their hearts;
      for they were the last words that he ever uttered in public: &ldquo;Let us hope
      that England, having saved herself by her energy, may save Europe by her
      example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was but a momentary rally. Austerlitz soon completed what Ulm had
      begun. Early in December Pitt <span class="pagenum">295</span><a
      name="link295" id="link295"></a>had retired to Bath, in the hope that he
      might there gather strength for the approaching session. While he was
      languishing there on his sofa arrived the news that a decisive battle had
      been fought and lost in Moravia, that the coalition was dissolved, that
      the Continent was at the feet of France. He sank down under the blow. Ten
      days later, he was, so emaciated that his most intimate friends hardly
      knew him. He came up from Bath by slow journeys, and, on the 11th of
      January, 1806, reached his villa at Putney. Parliament was to meet on the
      21st. On the 20th was to be the parliamentary dinner at the house of the
      First Lord of the Treasury in Downing Street; and the cards were already
      issued. But the days of the great minister were numbered. The only chance
      for his life, and that a very slight chance, was, that he should resign
      his office, and pass some months in profound repose. His colleagues paid
      him very short visits, and carefully avoided political conversation. But
      his spirit, long accustomed to dominion, could not, even in that
      extremity, relinquish hopes which everybody but himself perceived to be
      vain. On the day on which he was carried into his bedroom at Putney, the
      Marquess Wellesley, whom he had long loved, whom he had sent to govern
      India, and whose administration had been eminently able, energetic, and
      successful, arrived in London after an absence of eight years. The friends
      saw each other once more. There was an affectionate meeting, and a last
      parting. That it was a last parting Pitt did not seem to be aware. He
      fancied himself to be recovering, talked on various subjects cheerfully,
      and with an unclouded mind, and pronounced a warm and discerning eulogium
      on the Marquess&rsquo;s brother Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">296</span><a name="link296" id="link296"></a>never,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;met with any military man with whom it was so satisfactory to
      converse.&rdquo; The excitement and exertion of this interview were too much for
      the sick man. He fainted away; and Lord Wellesley left the house,
      convinced that the close was fast approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now members of Parliament were fast coming up to London. The chiefs of
      the opposition met for the purpose of considering the course to be taken
      on the first day of the session. It was easy to guess what would be the
      language of the King&rsquo;s speech, and of the address which would be moved in
      answer to that speech. An amendment condemning the policy of the
      government had been prepared, and was to have been proposed in the House
      of Commons by Lord Henry Petty, a young nobleman who had already won for
      himself that place in the esteem of his country which, after the lapse of
      more than half a century, he still retains. He was unwilling, however, to
      come forward as the accuser of one who was incapable of defending himself.
      Lord Grenville, who had been informed of Pitt&rsquo;s state by Lord Wellesley,
      and had been deeply affected by it, earnestly recommended forbearance; and
      Fox, with characteristic generosity and good nature, gave his voice
      against attacking his now helpless rival. &ldquo;Sunt lacryrmæ rerum,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;et men-tem mortalia tangunt.&rdquo; On the first day, therefore, there was no
      debate. It was rumoured that evening that Pitt was better. But on the
      following morning his physicians pronounced that there were no hopes. The
      commanding faculties of which he had been too proud were beginning to
      fail. His old tutor and friend, the Bishop of Lincoln, informed him of his
      danger, and gave such religious advice and consolation as a confused <span
      class="pagenum">297</span><a name="link297" id="link297"></a>and obscured
      mind could receive. Stories were told of devout sentiments fervently
      uttered by the dying man. But these stories found no credit with anybody
      who knew him. Wilberforce pronounced it impossible that they could be
      true. &ldquo;Pitt,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;was a man who always said less than he thought on
      such topics.&rdquo; It was asserted in many after-dinner speeches, Grub Street
      elegies, and academic prize poems and prize declamations, that the great
      minister died exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh my country!&rdquo; This is a fable: but it is true
      that the last words which he uttered, while he knew what he said, were
      broken exclamations about the alarming state of public affairs. He ceased
      to breathe on the morning of the 23rd of January, 1806, the twenty-fifth
      anniversary of the day on which he first took his seat in Parliament. He
      was in his forty-seventh year, and had been, during near nineteen years,
      First Lord of the Treasury, and undisputed chief of the administration.
      Since parliamentary government was established in England, no English
      statesman has held supreme power so long. Walpole, it is true, was first
      Lord of the Treasury during more than twenty years: but it was not till
      Walpole had been some time First Lord of the Treasury that he could be
      properly called Prime Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was moved in the House of Commons that Pitt should be honoured with a
      public funeral and a monument. The motion was opposed by Fox in a speech
      which deserves to be studied as a model of good taste and good feeling.
      The task was the most invidious that ever an orator undertook: but it was
      performed with a humanity and delicacy which were warmly acknowledged by
      the mourning friends of him who was gone. The motion was carried by 288
      votes to 89.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">298</span><a name="link298" id="link298"></a>22nd
      of February was fixed for the funeral. The corpse, having lain in state
      during two days in the Painted Chamber, was borne with great pomp to the
      northern transept of the Abbey. A splendid train of princes, nobles,
      bishops, and privy councillors followed. The grave of Pitt had been made
      near to the spot where his great father lay, near also to the spot where
      his great rival was soon to be. The sadness of the assistants was beyond
      that of ordinary mourners. For he whom they were committing to the dust
      had died of sorrows and anxieties of which none of the survivors could be
      altogether without a share. Wilberforce, who carried the banner before the
      hearse, described the awful ceremony with deep feeling. As the coffin
      descended into the earth, he said, the eagle face of Chatham from above
      seemed to look down with consternation into the dark house which was
      receiving: all that remained of so much power and glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      All parties in the House of Commons readily concurred in voting forty
      thousand pounds to satisfy the demands of Pitt&rsquo;s creditors. Some of his
      admirers seemed to consider the magnitude of his embarrassments as a
      circumstance highly honourable to him; but men of sense will probably be
      of a different opinion. It is far better, no doubt, that a great minister
      should carry his contempt of money to excess than that he should
      contaminate his hands with unlawful gain. But it is neither right nor
      becoming in a man to whom the public has given an income more than
      sufficient for his comfort and dignity to bequeath to that public a great
      debt, the effect of mere negligence and profusion. As First Lord of the
      Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Pitt never had less than six
      thousand a year, besides an excellent house. In 1792 <span class="pagenum">299</span><a
      name="link299" id="link299"></a>he was forced by his royal master&rsquo;s
      friendly importunity to accept for life the office of Warden of the Cinque
      Ports, with near four thousand a year more. He had neither wife nor child:
      he had no needy relations: he had no expensive tastes: he had no long
      election bills. Had he given but a quarter of an hour a week to the
      regulation of his household, he would have kept his expenditure within
      bounds. Or, if he could not spare even a quarter of an hour a week for
      that purpose, he had numerous friends, excellent men of business, who
      would have been proud to act as his stewards. One of those friends, the
      chief of a great commercial house in the city, made an attempt to put the
      establishment in Downing Street to rights; but in vain. He found that the
      waste of the servants&rsquo; hall was almost fabulous. The quantity of butcher&rsquo;s
      meat charged in the bills was nine hundred-weight a week. The consumption
      of poultry, of fish, and of tea was in proportion. The character of Pitt
      would have stood higher if, with the disinterestedness of Pericles and of
      De Witt, he had united their dignified frugality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of Pitt has been assailed, times innumerable, often justly,
      often unjustly; but it has suffered much less from his assailants than
      from his eulogists.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, during many years, his name was the rallying cry of a class of men
      with whom, at one of those terrible conjunctures which confound all
      ordinary distinctions, he was accidentally and temporarily connected, but
      to whom, on almost all great questions of principle, he was diametrically
      opposed. The haters of parliamentary reform called themselves Pittites,
      not choosing to remember that Pitt made three motions for parliamentary
      reform, and, that, though he thought that such a reform <span
      class="pagenum">300</span><a name="link300" id="link300"></a>could not
      safely be made while the passions excited by the French revolution were
      raging, he never uttered a word indicating that he should not be prepared
      at a more convenient season to bring the question forward a fourth time.
      The toast of protestant ascendency was drunk on Pitt&rsquo;s birthday by a set
      of Pittites who could not but be aware that Pitt had resigned his office
      because he could not carry Catholic emancipation. The defenders of the
      Test Act called themselves Pittites, though they could not be ignorant
      that Pitt had laid before George the Third unanswerable reasons for
      abolishing the Test Act. The enemies of free trade called themselves
      Pittites, though Pitt was far more deeply imbued with the doctrines of
      Adam Smith than either Fox or Grey. The very negro-drivers invoked the
      name of Pitt, whose eloquence was never more conspicuously displayed than
      when he spoke of the wrongs of the negro. This mythical Pitt, who
      resembles the genuine Pitt as little as the Charlemagne of Ariosto
      resembles the Charlemagne of Effinhard, has had his day. History will
      vindicate the real man from calumny disguised under the semblance of
      adulation, and will exhibit him as what he was, a minister of great
      talents, honest intentions, and liberal opinions, pre-eminently qualified,
      intellectually and morally, for the part of a parliamentary leader, and
      capable of administering, with prudence and moderation, the government of
      a prosperous and tranquil country, but unequal to surprising and terrible
      emergencies, and liable, in such emergencies, to err grievously, both on
      the side of weakness and on the side of violence.

      excellent works in which this important subject has lately been discussed,
      that of Mr. Stephen is the most comprehensive, and, in many respects, the
      most valuable. We are not aware that any opponent has appeared,
      sufficiently intrepid to deny his statements, or to dispute their results.
      The decent and cautious advocates of slavery carefully avoid all allusion
      to a publication which they feel to be unanswerable; and the boldest
      content themselves with misrepresenting and reviling what they cannot even
      pretend to confute. In truth, it is not too much to assert that, on the
      part of the slave-drivers and their supporters, this controversy has, for
      the most part, been conducted with a disingenuousness and a bitterness to
      which literary history furnishes no parallel. Most of the honourable and
      intelligent men whose names give respectability to the Colonial party,
      have, in prudence or in disgust, stood aloof from the contest. In their
      absence, the warfare has been carried on by a race of scribblers, who,
      like the mercenary Mohawks, so often our auxiliaries in Transatlantic
      campaigns, unite the indifference of the hireling to the ferocity of the
      cannibal; who take aim from an ambush, and who desire victory only that
      they may have the pleasure of scalping and torturing the vanquished.

      The friends of humanity and freedom have often boasted, with <span

      that the wise and good of hostile sects and factions seemed, when slavery
      or the slave-trade were in question, to forget their mutual antipathies:&mdash;that
      the introduction of this subject was to such men what the proclamation of
      a Crusade was to the warriors of the dark ages&mdash;a signal to suspend
      all their petty disputes, and to array themselves under the same holy
      banner, against the same accursed enemy. In this respect the slave-drivers
      are now even with us. They, too, may boast that, if our cause has received
      support from honest men of all religious and political parties, theirs has
      tended, in as great a degree, to combine and conciliate every form of
      violence and illiberally. Tories and Radicals, prebendaries and
      field-preachers, are to be found in their ranks. The only requisites for
      one who aspires to enlist, are a front of brass and a tongue of venom.

      But it is neither on facts nor on arguments that slavery seems now to
      depend for protection. It neither doubles, nor stands at bay. It has
      neither the ingenuity of the hare, nor the intrepidity of the lion. It
      defends itself, like the hunted polecat, by the loathsomeness with which
      it taints the atmosphere around it; and hopes to escape, by disgusting
      those whom it can neither weary nor subdue. We could say much on this
      subject. But the sum is, that &ldquo;the worm will do his kind&rdquo;&mdash;and we
      have a more important task to perform. It is our intention to analyse,
      very concisely, the valuable work of Mr. Stephen, (1) and afterwards to
      offer to our readers some remarks which the perusal of it has suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stephen begins, by inquiring into the origin and authority of the
      Colonial Slave-laws. It has been commonly supposed in England, that there
      exists some known local law in the Colonies, distinct from the law of
      England, by which the bondage of the Negro has been introduced and
      defined. There is, however, no such law. The Colonists could, at no time,
      venture to present an act for such a purpose to an
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Mr. Stephen&rsquo;s work cannot, of course, embrace any
     changes which may have taken place in West Indian
     Legislation during the last eighteen months or two years.
     Some partial modifications of the former code may have taken
     place during that time in three or four of the colonies, but
     these do not affect the general results.
</pre>
    <p>
      English <span class="pagenum">305</span><a name="link305" id="link305"></a>sovereign.
      The Spanish conquerors and the roving pirates of the Antilles had
      established that state: and the English settlers considered themselves as
      succeeding to the rights of the original despoilers of America. Those
      rights, as they at that time existed, may be summed up in one short and
      terrible maxim,&mdash;that the slave is <i>the absolute property</i> of
      the master. It is desirable that this should be known; because, although a
      few restraining statutes have of late years been passed, this odious
      principle is still the basis of all West Indian legislation. It is
      pre-supposed in all meliorating acts. It is the rule, and the restraints
      are exceptions. In the benefits which every other English subject derives
      from the common law, the Negro has no share. His master may lawfully treat
      him as he pleases, except in points regulated by express enactment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stephen proceeds to analyze the legal nature of the relation between
      the master and the slave. Throughout the West Indies, slavery is a
      constrained service,&mdash;a service without wages. In some of the
      colonies, indeed, there are acts which regulate the time of labour, and
      the amount of the subsistence which shall be given in return. But, from
      causes to which we shall hereafter advert, these acts are nugatory. In
      other islands, even these ostensible reforms have not taken place: and the
      owner may legally give his slaves as much to do, and as little to eat, as
      he thinks fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the islands, the master may legally imprison his slave. In all the
      islands he may legally flog him; and in some of the islands he may legally
      flog him at his discretion. The best of the meliorating acts promise
      little, and perform less. By some of them it is enacted, that the slave
      shall not be flogged, till recovered from the effects of his last flogging&mdash;by
      others, that he shall not receive more than a certain number of lashes in
      one day. These laws, useless as they are, have a meaning. But there are
      others which add insult to cruelty. In some of the Colonial Codes, there
      are facetious provisions that the slave shall not receive more than a
      certain number of lashes at one time, or for one fault. What is the legal
      definition of a time? Or who are the legal judges of a fault? If the
      master should chuse to say that it is a fault in his slave to have woolly
      hair, whom does the law authorize to contradict him?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just to say, that the murder of a slave is now a capital <span
      class="pagenum">306</span><a name="link306" id="link306"></a>crime. But
      the West Indian rules of evidence, to which we shall hereafter call the
      attention of onr readers, render the execution of the laws on this subject
      almost impossible. The most atrocious kinds of mutilation,&mdash;even
      those which in England are punished with death,&mdash;when committed upon
      the person of a slave, subject the offender only to a fine, or to a short
      imprisonment. In Dominica, for instance, &ldquo;to maim, deface, mutilate, or
      cruelly torture&rdquo; a slave, is a crime which is to be expiated by a line not
      exceeding one hundred pounds currency, or by imprisonment not exceeding
      the term of three months, By the law of Jamaica, a master who perpetrates
      any outrage short of murder on the person of a slave, is subject to a fine
      not exceeding one hundred pounds currency, or to imprisonment not
      exceeding the term of 12 months. In very atrocious cases, the court may
      direct the enfranchisement of the slave. But this, though a benefit, as
      far as it goes, to the Negro, is a very slight aggravation of the
      punishment of the master. At most, it is only an addition of a few pounds
      to the fine. And as the possession of a slave who has been maimed in such
      a maimer as to render him helpless, is rather burdensome than profitable,
      it would, in many eases, be really an advantage to the criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these terrible prerogatives were confined to the master alone, the
      condition of the slave would be suficiently wretched. Yet it would not be
      without alleviations. The proprietor might sometimes be restrained by a
      sense of his pecuniary interest, if not by higher considerations, from
      those extreme outrages, against which the law affords so scanty a
      protection. At all events, during his absence, his Negroes would enjoy an
      interval of security. Unhappily, the Colonial Codes permit all the
      representatives and agents of the master, black and white, bond and free,
      to exercise most of his despotic powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen that the slave has no legal property in his own body. It is
      almost unnecessary to say, that he has no property in any thing else,&mdash;that
      all his acquisitions belong, like himself, to his master. He is, in fact,
      a chattel. We should rather say, that to serve the purpose of rapacity and
      tyranny, he is alternately considered as real and as personal property. He
      may be sold or bequeathed at the pleasure of his master, he may be put up
      to auction by process of law, for <span class="pagenum">307</span><a
      name="link307" id="link307"></a>the benefit of the creditors or legatees
      of his master. In either of these ways he may be, in a moment, torn for
      ever from his home, his associates, his own children. He is, in addition
      to this, legally a subject of mortgages, demises, leases, settlements in
      tail, in remainder, and in reversion. The practice of raising money on
      this species of property, is favoured by the laws of all the Colonies, and
      has been equally fatal to the owner and to the slave. It is fatal to the
      owner, because it enables him to risk capital not his own, in the
      precarious lottery of the West Indian sugar trade. It is fatal to the
      slave, because, in the first place, while it leaves to the master all his
      power to oppress, it deprives hi in of his power to manumit; and secondly,
      because it leads the master to keep possession of his Negroes, and to
      compel them to labour, when he has no prospect of holding them long, and
      is therefore naturally inclined to make as much by them, and to spend as
      little upon them as possible,&mdash;a fact amply proved by the miserable
      state in which the gang is generally found, when transferred from the
      ruined planter to the half ruined mortgagee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the legal condition of the Negro, considered with reference to his
      master. We shall proceed to examine into the nature of the relation in
      which he stands towards free persons in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is not competent to be a party to any civil action, either as plaintiff
      or defendant; nor can he be received as informant or prosecutor against
      any person of free condition. He is protected only as a horse is protected
      in this country. His owner may bring an action against any person who may
      have occasioned the loss of his services. But it is plain that the slave
      may sustain many civil injuries, to which this circuitous mode of
      obtaining redress is not applicable; and even when it is applicable, the
      damages are awarded, not to the injured party, but to his master. The
      protection which indictments and criminal informations afford, is also of
      very narrow extent. Many crimes which, when committed against a white man,
      are considered as most atrocious, may be committed by any white man
      against a slave with perfect impunity. To rob a slave, for instance, is,
      in most of the islands, not even a misdemeanour. In this case, the grand
      principle of Colonial law is suspended. The property of a slave, it seems,
      is considered as belonging to his owner for the purpose <span
      class="pagenum">308</span><a name="link308" id="link308"></a>of
      oppression, but not for the purpose of protection. By the meliorating laws
      of some of the Colonies, the crime of highway robbery upon a Negro, is
      punished by fines, which, as far as we are informed, in no case exceed
      thirty pounds currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not all. The natural right of self-defence is denied to the
      slave. By the laws of almost all the islands, a slave who should defend
      himself from murder or torture, to the injury of a White person, though
      such White person should posess no authority whatever over him might be
      punished with death.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now come to the laws respecting the evidence of slaves,&mdash;laws
      which the Colonists stoutly defend,&mdash;and with reason; for, while
      these remain unaltered, the meliorating acts, feeble at best, must always
      be utterly inefficient. The testimony of these unfortunate beings is not
      admissible in any cause, civil or criminal, against a White person. To
      this general rule there are, in a very few of the smaller Colonies, some
      partial exceptions. It is needless to say, that every crime may be easily
      perpetrated in a community of which only one member in ten is a competent
      witness. The Government have pressed this point on the consideration of
      the Colonial Assemblies. In Jamaica, the proposed amendments were recently
      negatived by a majority of 34 to 1. In Barbadoes they have met with a
      similar reception. The only excuse we ever heard made for so disgraceful a
      law, is this, that the Negroes are ignorant of the nature and obligations
      of an oath, and, in fact, are scarcely responsible beings. But from this
      excuse the legislators of Jamaica have excluded themselves, by enacting,
      that a slave who commits perjury, in a criminal cause, against another
      slave, shall suffer the same punishment as the prisoner, if convicted,
      would have suffered. If a slave be ignorant of the nature of an oath, why
      is he admitted as a witness against any human being? Why is he punished,
      in some cases, with death, for an offence which subjects his more
      enlightened, and therefore, more guilty master, only to transportation?
      If, on the other hand, he possesses the moral and intellectual
      qualifications which are required in a witness, why is he not suffered to
      appear against an European?
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must proceed. The slave, thus excluded from the protection of the
      law, is subject to all its restraints. He undergoes <span class="pagenum">309</span><a
      name="link309" id="link309"></a>the miseries of a beast of burden, without
      enjoying its immunities. He is bound, notwithstanding that alleged
      inferiority of his understanding, which is admitted as a reason for
      curtailing his rights, but not for lightening his responsibility, by the
      whole of the criminal code which is in force against free persons. And, in
      addition to this, he is subjected to another most unjust and cruel code,
      made for his class alone. If he flies from the colony, he is put to death.
      If he goes beyond the limits of the plantation to which he is attached,
      without a written permission, he is liable to be severely punished.
      Actions in themselves perfectly innocent,&mdash;buying or selling certain
      goods in a market,&mdash;raising certain descriptions of produce,&mdash;possessing
      certain species of live stock,&mdash;are crimes for which the Negro is
      punished, unless he can produce a written authority from his owner. In
      some of the Glands, not even the command of his owner is admitted as an
      excuse. To beat a drum, to blow a horn, to dance, to play at quoits, to
      throw squibs, to make fireworks, are all offences when committed by a
      slave, and subject him to the cruel chastisement of the whip. When things
      merely indifferent are visited with such severe penalties, it may easily
      be imagined that real delinquencies are not very mercifully dealt with. In
      fact, many actions for which a White man is only imprisoned, or otherwise
      slightly punished, if punished at all, are capital crimes when committed
      by a slave. Such are stealing, or attempting to steal, to the value of
      12d. currency, killing any animal of the value of 6s., uttering mutinous
      words, and a long list of equally heinous crimes. We have already
      mentioned the infamous law which exists in Jamaica on the subject of
      perjury. Another of a most kingly character is in force in the same Isand.
      To compass or imagine the death of any of the White inhabitants, (God
      bless their Majesties!) is an enormity for which a slave is punished with
      death. It is contrary to the duty of their allegiance!
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the penal code to which the slaves are subject. The manner in
      which they are tried is, if possible, still more disgraceful. On charges
      which do not affect their lives, a single justice is, for the most part,
      competent to decide. In capital cases, several justices must attend, and,
      in most of the Colonies, a Jury is summoned, if that name can be applied
      where there is neither parity of condition nor right of challenge. <span
      class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310" id="link310"></a>No indictment
      is preferred No previous investigation takes place before a Grand Jury. In
      most of the Islands no record is drawn up. In some, it is enacted, that
      the execution shall immediately follow the sentence. The prisoner is now
      sufficiently lucky to be hanged. But formerly it was not unusual to
      inflict what the Colonial codes style &ldquo;exemplary punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When it was thought expedient to exercise this right, the offender was
      roasted alive, hung up in irons to perish by thirst, or shut up in a cage
      and starved to death! These punishments were commonly reserved for
      wretches who had committed the diabolical crime of insurrection against
      the just and paternal government, of which we have feebly attempted to
      delineate the excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bondage, of which we have given this description, is hereditary. It is
      entailed on the posterity of the slave to the remotest generations. The
      law does not compel his master to enfranchise him, on receiving a fair
      price. On the contrary, it interferes to prevent the master, even when so
      inclined, from giving him his liberty. In some of the islands a direct tax
      is imposed on manumission; and in all, the encouragement which is given to
      the practice of raising money on Negroes by mortgage, tends to obstruct
      their liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slavery in the West Indies is confined to Negroes and people of colour.
      This circumstance is peculiar to the slavery of the New World; and its
      effects are most calamitous. The external peculiarities of the African
      race are thus associated in the minds of the Colonists with every thing
      degrading, and are considered as the disgusting livery of the most abject
      servitude. Hence it is, that the free Negroes and Mulattoes he under so
      many legal disabilities, and experience such contemptuous treatment, that
      their condition can be esteemed desirable only when compared with the
      bondage to which it lias succeeded. Of the rules to which this class is
      subjected, we shall notice only one of the most odious. We speak of the
      presumption against liberty, which is a recognised principle of colonial
      law. The West Indian maxim is, that every Negro and Mulatto is to be
      considered as a slave, till, by documentary evidence, he can be proved to
      be otherwise. It may be notorious, that he has been free since he first
      resided in the colony,&mdash;that he has lived twenty years in England,&mdash;that
      he is a citizen of Hayti or Columbia. <span class="pagenum">311</span><a
      name="link311" id="link311"></a>All this is immaterial. If he cannot
      produce a deed of manumission, he is liable to be put up to sale by public
      auction! On this subject remarks would be superfluous. Thank God, we are
      writing; for a free people.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now accompanied Mr. Stephen through most of the leading topics of
      his work. We have occasionally departed from his arrangement, which indeed
      is not always the most convenient. This, however, is to be attributed, not
      to the author, but to the circumstances under which the work was composed.
      If there be any thing else to which we should be inclined to object, it is
      to the lengthened parallels which Mr. Stephen draws between the Slave laws
      of the West Indies and those which have existed in other countries. He is
      not, we think, too severe upon our Colonists. But we suspect that he is a
      little too indulgent to the Greeks and Romans. These passages are, at the
      same time, in a high degree curious and ingenious, though perhaps too long
      and too frequent. Such blemishes, however, if they can be called such,
      detract but in a very slight degree from the value of a book eminently
      distinguished by the copiousness and novelty of the information which it
      affords, by the force of its reasoning, and by the energy and animation of
      its style.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not alluded to that part of the work, in which the lamentable
      state of the law, on the subject of religious instruction, is described;
      because the evil has been universally acknowledged, and something intended
      for a remedy has at last been provided. The imagined specific, as our
      readers are aware, is an Ecclesiastical Establishment. This measure, we
      doubt not, is well intended. But we feel convinced that, unless combined
      with other reforms, it will prove almost wholly useless. The immorality
      and irreligion of the slaves are the necessary consequences of their
      political and personal degradation. They are not considered by the law as
      human beings. And they have therefore, in some measure, ceased to be human
      beings. They must become men before they can become Christians. A great
      effect may, under fortunate circumstances, have been wrought on particular
      individuals: But those who believe that any extensive effect can be
      produced by religious instruction on this miserable race, may believe in
      the famous conversion wrought by St. Anthony on the fish. Can a preacher
      prevail on his bearers strictly to fulfil their conjugal duties in a
      country where <span class="pagenum">312</span><a name="link312"
       id="link312"></a>no protection is given to their conjugal rights.&mdash;in
      a country where the husband and wife may, at the pleasure of the master,
      or by process of law, be in an instant, separated for ever? Can he
      persuade them to rest on the Sunday, in Colonies where the law appoints
      that time for the markets? Is there any lesson which a Christian minister
      is more solemnly bound to teach,&mdash;is there any lesson which it is, in
      a religious point of view,&mdash;more important for a convert to learn,
      than that it is a duty to refuse obedience to the unlawful commands of
      superiors? Are the new pastors of the slaves to inculcate this principle
      or not? In other words, are the slaves to remain uninstruted in the
      fundamental laws of Christian morality, or are their teachers to be
      hanged? This is the alternative. We all remember that it was made a charge
      against Mr. Smith, that he had read an inflammatory chapter of the Bible
      to his congregation,&mdash;excellent encouragement for their future
      teachers to &ldquo;declare unto them,&rdquo; according to the expression of an old
      divine, far too methodistical to be considered as an authority in the West
      Indies, &ldquo;the whole counsel of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great body of the Colonists have resolutely opposed religious
      instruction; and they are in the right. They know, though their
      misinformed friends in England do not know, that Christianity and slavery
      cannot long exist together. We have already given it us our opinion, that
      the great body of the Negroes can never, while their political state
      remains the same, be expected to become Christians. But, if that were
      possible, we are sure that their political state would very speedily be
      changed. At every step which the Negro makes in the knowledge and
      discrimination of right and wrong, he will learn to reprobate more and
      more the system under which he lives. He will not indeed be so prone to
      engage in rash and foolish tumults; but he will be as willing as he now is
      to struggle for liberty, and far more capable of struggling with effect.
      The forms in which Christianity has been at different times disguised,
      have been often hostile to liberty. But wherever the spirit has surmounted
      the forms,&mdash;in France, during the wars of the Huguenots,&mdash;in
      Holland, during the reign of Philip II.,&mdash;in Scotland, at the time of
      the Reformation,&mdash;in England, through the whole contest against the
      Stuarts, from their accession to their expulsion.&mdash;in New-England,
      through its whole history,&mdash;in every place,&mdash;<span
      class="pagenum">313</span><a name="link313" id="link313"></a>in every age,&mdash;it
      lias inspired a hatred of oppression, and a love of freedom! It would be
      thus in the West-Indies. The attempts which have been made to press a few
      detached texts into the cause of tyranny, have never produced any
      extensive effect. Those who cannot refute them by reasoning and
      comparison, will be hurried forward by the sense of intolerable wrongs,
      and the madness of wounded affection. All this the Colonists have
      discovered; and we feel assured that they will never suffer religious
      instruction to be unreservedly given to the slaves. In that case, the
      Establishment will degenerate into a job. This is no chimerical
      apprehension. There have been clergymen in the West-Indies for many years
      past; and what have they done for the Negroes? In what have they conduced,
      either to their temporal or to their spiritual welfare? Doubtless there
      have been respectable men among them. But is it not notorious, that the
      benefices of the colonies have been repeatedly given to the outcasts of
      English society,&mdash;men whom the inhabitants would not venture to
      employ as book-keepers, yet whom they desired to retain as boon
      companions? Any person who will look over the Parliamentary papers which
      contain the answers returned by the colonial clergy to certain queries
      sent out a few years ago by Lord Bathurst, will see some curious instances
      of the ignorance, the idleness, and the levity of that body. Why should
      the new Establishment be less corrupt than the old? The dangers to which
      it is exposed are the same; we do not see that its securities are much
      greater. It has Bishops, no doubt; and when we observe that Bishops are
      more active than their inferiors on this side of the Atlantic, we shall
      begin to hope that they may be useful on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reforms have begun at the wrong end. &ldquo;God,&rdquo; says old Hooker, no
      enemy to Episcopal Establishments, &ldquo;first assigned Adam maintenance for
      life, and then appointed him a law to observe.&rdquo; Our rulers would have done
      well to imitate the example,&mdash;to give some security to the hearth and
      to the back of the slave, before they sent him Bishops, Archdeacons, and
      Chancellors and Chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of Mr. Stephen has, we think, disposed forever of some of the
      principal arguments which are urged by the Colonists. If those who
      conscientiously support slavery be open to conviction, if its dishonest
      advocates be susceptible of <span class="pagenum">314</span><a
      name="link314" id="link314"></a>shame, they can surely never again resort
      to that mode of defence, which they have so often employed when hard
      pressed by some particular case of oppression. On such occasions their cry
      has been, &ldquo;There are individual instances. You must not deduce general
      conclusions from them. What would you say, if we were to form our estimate
      of English society from the Police Reports, or the Newgate Calendar? Look
      at the rules, and not at the exceptions.&rdquo; Here, then, we have those
      boasted rides. And what are they? We find that the actions which other
      societies punish as crimes, are in the West Indies sanctioned by law;&mdash;that
      practices, of which England affords no example but in the records of the
      jail and the gibbet, are there suffered to exist unpunished;&mdash;that
      atrocities may there be perpetrated in the drawing-room or in the
      market-place, on the persons of untried and unconvicted individuals, which
      here would scarcely find an asylum in the vaults of the Blood-Bowl House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it any answer to this charge, now most fully established, to say that
      we too have our crimes? Unquestionably, under all systems, however wise,
      under all circumstances, however fortunate, the passions of men will
      incite them to evil. The most vigilant police, the most rigid tribunals,
      the severest penalties, are but imperfect restraints upon avarice and
      revenge. What then must be the ease when these restraints are withdrawn?
      In England there is a legal remedy for every injury. If the first prince
      of the blood, were to treat the poorest pauper in St. Giles&rsquo;s as the best
      code in the West Indies authorizes a master to treat his slave, it would
      be better for him that he had never been born. Yet even here we find, that
      wherever power is given, it is occasionally abused; that magistrates, not
      having the fear of the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench before their eyes, will
      sometimes be guilty of injustice and tyranny, that even parents will
      sometimes starve, torture, murder the helpless beings to whom they have
      given life. And is it not evident, that where there are fewer checks,
      there will be more cruelty?
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are told, the manners of a people, the state of public opinion, are
      of more real consequence than any written code. Many things, it is
      confessed, in the Colonial laws, are cruel and unjust in theory: but we
      are assured that the feeling of the Colonists renders the practical
      operation of the system lenient and liberal. We answer, that publie
      feeling, though <span class="pagenum">315</span><a name="link315"
       id="link315"></a>an excellent auxiliary to laws, always has been, and
      always must be, a miserable and inefficient substitute for them. The rules
      of evidence on which public opinion proceeds are defective, and its
      decisions are capricious. Its condemnation frequently spares the guilty,
      and falls on the innocent. It is terrible to sensitive and generous minds;
      but it is disregarded by those whose hardened depravity most requires
      restraint. Hence its decrees, however salutary, unless supported by the
      clearer definitions and stronger sanctions of legislation, will be daily
      and hourly infringed; and with principles which rest only on public
      opinion, frequent infraction amounts to a repeal. Nothing that is very
      common can be very disgraceful. Thus public opinion, when not strengthened
      by positive enactment, is first defied, and then vitiated. At best it is a
      feeble check to wickedness, and at last it becomes its most powerful
      auxiliary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a remedy for the evils of a system of slavery, public opinion must be
      utterly inefficacious; and that for this simple reason, that the opinion
      of the slaves themselves goes for nothing. The desire which we feel to
      obtain the approbation, and to avoid the censure of our neighbours, is no
      innate or universal sentiment. It always springs, directly or indirectly,
      from consideration of the power which others possess to serve or to injure
      us. The good will of the lower orders, is courted only in countries where
      they possess political privileges, and where there is much they can give,
      and much that they can take away. Their opinion is important or
      unimportant, in proportion as their legal rights are great or small. It
      can, therefore, never be a substitute for legal rights. Does a Smithfield
      drover care for the love or hatred of his oxen? and yet his oxen, since
      the passing of Mr. Martin&rsquo;s meliorating act, are scarcely in a more
      unprotected condition than the slaves in our islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion then, which is to guard the slaves from the oppressions of the
      privileged order, is the opinion of the privileged order itself. A vast
      authority is intrusted to the master&mdash;the law imposes scarcely tiny
      restraints upon him&mdash;and we are required to believe, that the place
      of all other checks will be fully supplied by the general sense of those
      who participate in his power and his temptations. This may be reason at
      Kingston; but will it pass at Westminster? We are not inveighing against
      the white inhabitants of the West <span class="pagenum">316</span><a
      name="link316" id="link316"></a>Indies. We do not say that they are
      naturally more cruel or more sensual than ourselves. But we say that they
      are men; and they desire to be considered as angels!&mdash;we say as
      angels, for to no human being, however generous and beneficent, to no
      philanthropist, to no fathers of the church, could powers like theirs be
      safely intrusted. Such authority a parent ought not to have over his
      children. They ask very complacently, &ldquo;Are we men of a different species
      from yourselves? We come among you;&mdash;we mingle with you in all your
      kinds of business and pleasure;&mdash;we buy and sell with you on Change
      in the morning;&mdash;we dance with your daughters in the evening. Are not
      our manners civil? Are not our dinners good? Are we not kind friends, fair
      dealers, generous benefactors? Are not our names in the subscription lists
      of all your charities? And can you believe that we are such monsters as
      the saints represent us to be? Can you imagine that, by merely crossing
      the Atlantic, we acquire a new nature?&rdquo; We reply, You are not men of a
      different species from ourselves; and, therefore, we will not give you
      powers with which we would not dare to trust ourselves. We know that your
      passions are like ours. We know that your restraints are fewer; and,
      therefore, we know that your crimes must be greater. Are despotic
      sovereigns men of harder hearts by nature than their subjects? Are they
      born with a hereditary thirst for blood&mdash;with a natural incapacity
      for friendship? Surely not. Yet what is their general character? False&mdash;cruel&mdash;licentious&mdash;-ungrateful.
      Many of them have performed single acts of splendid generosity and
      heroism; a few may be named whose general administration has been
      salutary; but scarcely one has passed through life without committing at
      least some one atrocious act, from the guilt and infamy of which
      restricting laws would have saved him and his victims. If Henry VIII. had
      been a private man, he might have torn his wife&rsquo;s ruff, and kicked her
      lap-dog. He was a King, and he cutoff her head&mdash;not that his passions
      were more brutal than those of many other men, but that they were less
      restrained. How many of the West Indian overseers can boast of the piety
      and magnanimity of Theodosius? Yet, in a single moment of anger, that
      amiable prince destroyed more innocent people than all the ruffians in
      Europe stab in fifty years. Thus it is with a master in the Colonies. We
      will suppose him to be <span class="pagenum">317</span><a name="link317"
       id="link317"></a>a good natured man, but subject, like other men, to
      occasional fits of passion. He gives an order. It is slowly or negligently
      executed. In England he would grumble, perhaps swear a little. In the West
      Indies, the law empowers him to indict a severe flogging on the loiterer.
      Are we very uncharitable in supposing that he will sometimes exercise his
      privilege?
    </p>
    <p>
      It by no means follows that a person who is humane in England will be
      humane to his Negroes in the West Indies. Nothing is so capricious and
      inconsistent as the compassion of men. The Romans were people of the same
      flesh and blood with ourselves&mdash;they loved their friends&mdash;they
      cried at tragedies&mdash;they gave money to beggars;&mdash;yet we know
      their fondness for gladiatorial shows. When, by order of Pompey, some
      elephants were tortured in the amphitheatre, the audience was so shocked
      at the yells and contortions by which the poor creatures expressed their
      agony, that they burst forth into execrations against their favourite
      general. The same people, in the same place, had probably often given the
      fatal twirl of the thumb which condemned some gallant barbarian to receive
      the sword. In our own time, many a man shoots partridges in such numbers
      that he is compelled to bury them, who would chastise his son for amusing
      himself with the equally interesting, and not more cruel diversion, of
      catching flies and tearing them to pieces. The drover goads oxen&mdash;the
      fishmonger crimps cod&mdash;the dragoon sabres a Frenchman&mdash;the
      Spanish Inquisition burns a Jew&mdash;the Irish gentleman torments a
      Catholic. These persons are not necessarily destitute of feeling. Each of
      them would shrink from any cruel employment, except that to which his
      situation has familiarized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one way in which the West Indians will ever convince the
      people of England that their practice is merciful, and that is, by making
      their laws merciful. We cannot understand why men should so tenaciously
      fight for powers which they do not mean to exercise. If the oppressive
      privileges of the master be nominal and not real, let him cede them, and
      silence calumny at once and for ever. Let him cede them for his own
      honour. Let him cede them in compliance with the desire, the vain and
      superfluous desire, we will suppose, of the people of England. Is the
      repeal of laws which have become obsolete,&mdash;is the prohibition <span
      class="pagenum">318</span><a name="link318" id="link318"></a>of crimes
      which are never committed, too great a return for a bounty of twelve
      hundred thousand pounds, for a protecting duty most injurious to the
      manufacturers of England and the cultivators of Hindustan, for an army
      which alone protects from inevitable ruin the lives and possessions of the
      Colonists?
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact notoriously is, that West Indian manners give protection even to
      those extreme enormities against which the West Indian laws provide. We
      have already adverted to one of the most ordinary sophisms of our
      opponents. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; they exclaim, &ldquo;is our whole body to be censured for the
      depravity of a few? Every society has its miscreants. If we had our Hodge,
      you had your Thurtell. If we had our Huggins, you had your Wall. No candid
      reasoner will ground general charges on individual eases.&rdquo; The refutation
      is simple. When a community does nothing to prevent guilt, it ought to
      bear the blame of it. Wickedness, when punished, is disgraceful only to
      the offender. Unpunished, it is disgraceful to the whole society. Our
      charge against the Colonists is not that crimes are perpetrated among
      them, but that they are tolerated. We will give a single instance. Since
      the West Indians are fond of referring to our Newgate Calendar, we will
      place, side by side, a leaf from that melancholy Register, and another
      from the West Indian Annals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wall was Governor at Goree. In that situation he flogged a man to
      death, on pretence of mutiny. On his return to England, he was indicted
      for murder. He escaped to the Continent. For twenty years he remained in
      exile. For twenty years the English people retained the impression of his
      crime uneffaced within their hearts. He shifted his residence&mdash;he
      disguised his person&mdash;he changed his name,&mdash;still their eyes
      were upon him, for evil, and not for good. At length, conceiving that all
      danger was at an end, he returned. He was tried, convicted, and hanged,
      amidst the huzzas of an innumerable multitude. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Huggins of Nevis, about fifteen years ago, flogged upwards of
      twenty slaves in the public market-place, with such severity as to produce
      the death of one, and to ruin the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) We should be far, indeed, from applauding those shouts,
     if they were the exultation of cruelty; but they arose from
     the apprehension that Court favour was about to save the
     criminal; and the feeling expressed was for the triumph of
     justice.
</pre>
    <p>
      constitutions <span class="pagenum">319</span><a name="link319"
       id="link319"></a>of many. He had grossly violated the law of the Colony,
      which prescribes a limit to such inflictions. He had violated it in open
      day, and in the presence of a magistrate. He was indicted by the law
      officer of the crown. His advocate acknowledged the facts, but argued that
      the act on which he was tried, was passed only to silence the zealots in
      England, and was never intended to be enforced. Huggins was acquitted! But
      that was a trifle. Some members of the House of Assembly lost their seats
      at the next election, for taking part against him. A printer of a
      neighbouring island was convicted of a libel, merely for publishing an
      official report of the evidence, transmitted to him by authority. In a
      word, he was considered as a martyr to the common cause, and grew in
      influence and popularity; while a most respectable planter, an enlightened
      and accomplished gentleman, Mr. Tobin, who, nobly despising the prejudices
      of his class, had called the attention of the government to these
      diabolical outrages, was menaced with prosecutions, assailed with
      slanders, and preserved only by blindness from challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let these cases be compared. We do not say that Wall was not as bad a man
      as Huggins; but we do say that the English people have nothing to do with
      the crime of Wall, and that the public character of the people of Nevis
      suffers seriously by the crime of Huggins. They have adopted the guilt,
      and they must share in the infamy. We know that the advocates of slavery
      affect to deride this and similar narratives as old and threadbare. They
      sneer at them in conversation, and cough them down in the House of
      Commons. But it is in vain. They are written on the hearts of the people;
      and they will be remembered when all the smooth nothings of all the
      official defenders of such transactions are forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is simply this. Bad laws and bad customs, reciprocally producing
      and produced by each other, have given to the Whites in all the slave
      islands&mdash;Dutch, Spanish, French and English&mdash;a peculiar
      character, in which almost all the traits, which, in this quarter of the
      world, distinguish the different nations, are lost. We think we describe
      that character sufficiently when we call it the despotic character. In
      nothing does this temper more strongly appear than in the rage and
      contempt with which the Colonists receive<span class="pagenum">320</span><a
      name="link320" id="link320"></a> every command, and indeed every
      admonition, from the authorities of the mother country. When the
      territorial power and the commercial monopoly of the East India Company
      haws been at stake, has that great body conducted itself thus? Do even
      foreign powers treat us in this manner? We have often remonstrated with
      the greatest sovereigns of the Continent on the subject of the slave
      trade. We have been repulsed&mdash;we have been deluded. But by whom have
      we been insulted? The representations of the King and people of England
      have never been met with outrageous scorn and anger,&mdash;except by the
      men who owe their food to our bounties, and their lives to our troops. To
      the most gentle and moderate advice, to the suggestions of the most
      respectable of the West Indian proprietors resident in England, they reply
      only in ravings of absurd slander, or impotent defiance. The essays in
      their newspapers, the speeches of their legislators, the resolutions of
      their vestries, are, almost without exception, mere collections of
      rancorous abuse, unmixed with argument. If the Antislavery Society would
      publish a small tract, containing simply the leading articles of five or
      six numbers of the Jamaica Gazette, without note or comment, they would,
      we believe, do more to illustrate the character of their adversaries than
      by any other means which can be devised. Such a collection would exhibit
      to the country the real nature of that malignant spirit which banished
      Salisbury, which destroyed Smith, and which broke the honest heart of
      Ramsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable, that most of these zealots of slavery have little or no
      pecuniary interest in the question. If the colonies should be ruined, the
      loss will fall, not upon the book-keepers, the overseers, the herd of
      needy emigrants who make up the noisy circles of Jamaica; but upon the
      Ellises, the Hibberts, the Mannings, men of the most respectable
      characters and enlightened minds in the country. <i>They</i> might have
      been excused, if any person could be excused, for employing violent and
      abusive language. Yet they have conducted themselves, not perhaps exactly
      as we might wish them, but still like gentlemen, like men of sense, like
      men of feeling. Why is this? Simply because they live in England, and
      participate in English feelings. The Colonists, on the other hand, are
      degraded by familiarity with oppression. Let us not be deceived. The cry
      which resounds from the West <span class="pagenum">321</span><a
      name="link321" id="link321"></a>Indies is raised by men, who are trembling
      less for their property than for the privileges of their caste. These are
      the persons who love slavery for its own sake. The declarations so often
      made by the Parliament, by the Ministers, by the deadliest enemies of
      slavery, that the interests of all parties will be fairly considered, and
      that wherever a just claim to compensation can be established,
      compensation will be given, bring no comfort to them. They may have no
      possessions, but they have white faces. Should compensation be given, few
      of them will receive a sixpence; but they will lose the power of
      oppressing with impunity every man who has a black skin. And it is to
      these men, who have scarcely any interest in the value of colonial
      property, but who have a deep interest,&mdash;the interest of a petty
      tyranny, and a despicable pride in the maintenance of colonial injustice,
      that the British Parliament is required to give up its unquestionable
      right of superintendence over every part of our empire. If this were
      requested as a matter of indulgence, or recommended as a matter of
      expediency, we might well be surprised. But it is demanded as a
      constitutional right. On what does this right rest? On what statute? On
      what charter? On what precedent? On what analogy? That the uniform
      practice of past ages has been against their claim, they themselves do not
      venture to deny. Do they mean to assert, that a parliament in which they
      are not represented ought not to legislate for them? That question we
      leave them to settle with their friends of the Quarterly Review and the
      John Bull newspaper, who, we hope, will enlighten them on the subject of
      virtual representation. If ever that expression could be justly used, it
      would be in the present case; for probably there is no interest more fully
      represented in both Houses of Parliament, than that of the colonial
      proprietors. But for ourselves we answer, What have you to do with such
      doctrines? If you will adopt the principles of liberty, adopt them
      altogether. Every argument which you can urge in support of your own
      claims, might be employed, with far greater justice, in favour of the
      emancipation of your bondsmen. When that event shall have taken place,
      your demand will deserve consideration. At present, what you require under
      the name of freedom is nothing but unlimited power to oppress. It is the
      freedom of Nero.

    <p>
      &ldquo;But <span class="pagenum">322</span><a name="link322" id="link322"></a>we
      will rebel!&rdquo; Who can refrain from thinking of Captain Lemuel Gulliver,
      who, while raised sixty feet from the ground on the hand of the King of
      Brohdignag, claps his hand on his sword and tells his Majesty that he
      knows how to defend himself? You will rebel! Bravely resolved, most
      magnanimous Grildrig! But remember the wise remark of Lord Beelington&mdash;&ldquo;courage
      without power,&rdquo; said that illustrious exile, &ldquo;is like a consumptive
      running footman.&rdquo; What are your means of resistance? Are there, in all the
      islands put together, ten thousand white men capable of hearing arms? Are
      not your forces, such as they are, divided into small portions which can
      never act in concert? But this is mere trifling. Are you, in point of
      fact, at this moment able to protect yourselves against your slaves
      without our assistance? If you can still rise up and be down in security&mdash;if
      you can still eat the bread of the fatherless, and grind the faces of the
      poor&mdash;if you can still hold your petty parliaments, and say your
      little speeches, and move, your little motions&mdash;if you can still
      outrage and insult the Parliament and people of England, to what do you
      owe it? To nothing but to our contemptuous mercy. If we suspend our
      protection&mdash;if we recall our troops&mdash;in a week the knife is at
      your throats!
    </p>
    <p>
      Look to it, that we do not take you at your word. What are you to us that
      we should pamper and defend you? If the Atlantic Ocean should pass over
      you, and your place know you no more, what should we lose? Could we find
      no other cultivators to accept of our enormous bounties on sugar?&mdash;no
      other pestilential region to which we might send our soldiers to catch the
      yellow fever?&mdash;no other community for which we might pour forth our
      blood and lavish our money, to purchase nothing but injuries and insults?
      What do we make by you? If England is no longer to be the <i>mistress</i>
      of her colonies,&mdash;if she is to be only the handmaid of their
      pleasures, or the accomplice of their crimes, she may at least venture to
      ask, as a handmaid, what are to be the wages of her service,&mdash;as an
      accomplice, what is to be her portion of the spoil? If justice, and mercy,
      and liberty, and the law of God, and the happiness of man, be words
      without a meaning, we at least talk to the purpose when we talk of pounds,
      shillings, and pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us count our gains. Let us bring to the test the lofty phrases <span
      class="pagenum">323</span><a name="link323" id="link323"></a>of Colonial
      declamation. The West Indies, we are told, are a source of vast wealth and
      revenue to the country. They are a nursery of seamen. They take great
      quantities of our manufactures. They add to our political importance. They
      are useful posts in time of war. These absurdities have been repeated,
      till they have begun to impose upon the impostors who invented them. Let
      us examine them briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our commercial connexion with the West Indies is simply this. We buy our
      sugar from them at a higher price than is given for it in any other part
      of the world. The surplus they export to the Continent, where the price is
      lower; and we pay them the difference out of our own pockets. Our trade
      with the West Indies is saddled with almost all the expense of their civil
      and military establishments, and with a bounty of 1,200,000l. Let these be
      deducted from the profits of which we hear so much, and their amount will
      shrink indeed. Let us then deduct from the residue the advantages which we
      relinquish in order to obtain it,&mdash;that is to say, the profits of a
      free sugar trade all over the world; and then we shall be able to estimate
      the boasted gains of a connexion to which we have sacrificed the Negroes
      in one hemisphere, and the Hindoos in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the West Indians take great quantities of our manufactures! They can
      take only a return for the commodities which they send us. And from
      whatever country we may import the same commodities, to that country must
      we send out the same returns. What is it that now limits the demands of
      our Eastern empire? Absolutely nothing but the want of an adequate return.
      From that immense market&mdash;from the custom of one hundred millions of
      consumers, our manufacturers are in a great measure excluded, by the
      protecting duties on East Indian sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a great revenue is derived from the West Indian trade! Here, again, we
      have the same fallacy. As long as the present quantity of sugar is
      imported into England, no matter from what country, the revenue will not
      suffer; and, in proportion as the price of sugar is diminished, the
      consumption, and, consequently, the revenue, must increase. But the West
      Indian trade affords extensive employment to British shipping and seamen!
      Why more than any equally extensive trade with any other part of the
      world? The more <span class="pagenum">324</span><a name="link324"
       id="link324"></a>active our trade, the more demand there will be for
      shipping and seamen; and every one who has learnt the alphabet of
      Political Economy, knows that trade is active, in proportion only as it is
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some who assert that, in a military and political point of view,
      the West Indies are of great importance to this country. This is a common,
      but a monstrous misrepresentation. We venture to say, that Colonial empire
      has been one of the greatest curses of modern Europe. What nation has it
      ever strengthened? What nation has it ever enriched? What have been its
      fruits? Wars of frequent occurrence and immense cost, fettered trade,
      lavish expenditure, clashing jurisdiction, corruption in governments, and
      indigence among the people. What have Mexico and Peru done for Spain, the
      Brazils for Portugal, Batavia for Holland? Or, if the experience of others
      is lost upon us, shall we not profit by our own? What have we not
      sacrificed to our infatuated passion for transatlantic dominion? This it
      is that has so often led us to ri.-k our own smiling gardens and dear
      firesides for some snowy desert or infections morass on the other side of
      the globe: This inspired us with the project of conquering America in
      Germany: This induced us to resign all the advantages of our insular
      situation&mdash;to embroil ourselves in the intrigues, and fight the
      battles of half the Continent&mdash;to form coalitions which were
      instantly broken&mdash;-and to give subsidies which were never earned:
      This gave birth to the fratricidal war against American liberty, with all
      its disgraceful defeats, and all its barren victories, and all the
      massacres of the Indian hatchet, and all the bloody contracts of the
      Hessian slaughterhouse: This it was which, in the war against the French
      republic, induced us to send thousands and tens of thousands of our
      bravest troops to die in West Indian hospitals, while the armies of our
      enemies were pouring over the Rhine and the Alps. When a colonial
      acquisition has been in prospect, we have thought no expenditure
      extravagant, no interference perilous. Gold has been to us as dust, and
      blood as water. Shall we never learn wisdom? Shall we never cease to
      prosecute a pursuit wilder than the wildest dream of alchemy, with all the
      credulity and all the profusion of Sir Epicure Mammon?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who maintain that settlements so remote conduce to the military or
      maritime power of nations, fly in the face of history. <span
      class="pagenum">325</span><a name="link325" id="link325"></a>The colonies
      of Spain were far more extensive and populous than ours. Has Spain, at any
      time within the last two centuries, been a match for England either by
      land or by sea? Fifty years ago, our colonial dominions in America were
      far larger and more prosperous than those which we at present possess.
      Have we since that time experienced any decay in our political influence,
      in our opulence, or in our security? Or shall we say that Virginia was a
      less valuable possession than Jamaica, or Massachusetts than Barbadoes?
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, that all the evils of our Colonial system are immensely
      aggravated in the West Indies by the peculiar character of the state of
      slavery which exists there. Our other settlements we have to defend only
      against foreign invasion. These we must protect against the constant
      enmity of the miserable bondsmen, who are always waiting for the moment of
      deliverance, if not of revenge. With our other establishments we may
      establish commercial relations advantageous to both parties. But these are
      in a state of absolute pauperism; for what are bounties and forced prices
      but an enormous poor-rate in disguise?
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the benefits for which we are to be thankful. These are the
      benefits, in return for which we are to suffer a handful of managers and
      attorneys to insult the King, Lords, and Commons of England, in the
      exercise of rights as old and sacred as any part of our Constitution. It
      the proudest potentate in Europe, if the King of France, or the Emperor of
      all the Russias, had treated our Government as these creatures of our own
      have dared to do, should we not have taken such satisfaction as would have
      made the ears of all that heard of it to tingle? Would there not have been
      a stately manifesto, and a warlike message to both Houses, and vehement
      speeches from all parties, and unanimous addresses abounding in offers of
      lives and fortunes? If any <i>English mob</i>, composed of the disciples
      of Paine and Carlile, should dare to pull down a place of religious
      worship, to drive the minister from his residence, to threaten with
      destruction any other who should dare to take his place, would not the
      yeomanry be called out? Would not Parliament be summoned before the
      appointed time? Would there not be sealed bags and secret committees, and
      suspensions of the Habeas Corpus act? In Barbadoes all this has been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <span class="pagenum">326</span><a name="link326" id="link326"></a>has
      been done openly. It has <i>not</i> been punished. It is at this hour a
      theme of boasting and merriment. And what is the language of our rulers?
      &ldquo;We must not irritate them. We must try lenient measures. It is better
      that such unfortunate occurrences should not be brought before the
      Parliament.&rdquo; Surely the mantle, or rather the cassock, of Sir Hugh Evans,
      has descended on these gentlemen. &ldquo;It is not meet the council hear a riot.
      There is no fear of Got in a riot. The council, look you, shall desire to
      hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot.&rdquo; We have outdone all the
      most memorable examples of patience. The Job of Holy Writ, the Griselda of
      profane romance, were but types of our philosophy. Surely our endurance
      must be drawing to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not wish that England should drive forth her prodigal offspring to
      wear the rags and feed on the husks which they have desired. The Colonists
      have deserved such a punishment. But, for the sake of the slaves, for the
      sake of those persons, residing in this country, who are interested in
      West Indian property, we should grieve to see it indicted. That the
      slaves, when no longer restrained by our troops, would, in no very long
      time, achieve their own liberation, cannot be doubted. As little do we
      doubt that such a revolution, violent as it would doubtless be, would be
      desirable, if it were the only possible means of subverting the present
      system. The horrors of a battle or a massacre force themselves upon our
      senses. The effects of protracted tyranny, the terror, the degradation,
      the blighted affections, the stunted intellects, the pining of the heart,
      the premature decay of the frame, are evils less obvious, but equally
      certain; and, when continued through successive generations, make up a
      greater sum of human misery than was ever indicted in the paroxysm of any
      revolution. Still we cannot doubt that savages, rude in understanding,
      exasperated by injuries, intoxicated by recent freedom, would be much
      benefited by the wise and merciful control of an enlightened people.
    </p>
    <p>
      We feel also for the West Indian proprietors who reside in England.
      Between them and the inhabitants of the Colonies we see a great
      distinction. There may be in this body individuals infected with the worst
      vices of the colonial character. But there are also among them many
      gentlemen of benevolent feelings and enlarged minds, who have done much to
      <span class="pagenum">327</span><a name="link327" id="link327"></a>alleviate
      the condition of their slaves, and who would willingly see the meliorating
      measures which his Majesty&rsquo;s ministers have suggested, adopted by the West
      Indian legislators. They have scarcely any thing in common with the
      Colonists, or with the scribblers whom the Colonists feed and clothe. They
      have taken little part in the controversy, ashamed probably of the
      infamous allies with whom they would have to cooperate. But what they have
      said has, upon the whole, been said manfully and courteously. Their
      influence, however, is at present exerted decidedly in favour of slavery,
      not, we verily believe, from any love of slavery in the abstract, but
      partly because they think that their own characters are in some degree
      affected by the attacks which are made on the Colonial system, and partly
      because they apprehend that their property is likely to suffer in
      consequence of the feeling which at present prevails throughout the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      On both points they are mistaken. We are convinced that there is not, in
      any quarter, a feeling unfriendly to them, or an indisposition to give a
      fair consideration to their interests. The honest, but uninformed zeal, of
      individuals, may sometimes break forth into intemperate expressions: But
      the great body of the people make a wide distinction between the class of
      which we speak and the Colonial mob. Let it be their care to preserve that
      distinction indelible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We call for their support. They are our natural allies. Scarcely have the
      Ministers of the Crown, scarcely have the Abolitionists themselves, been
      more rancorously abused by the orators of Jamaica, than those persons. The
      objects of the two classes are wholly different. The one consists of
      English gentlemen, naturally solicitous to preserve the source from which
      they derive a part of their revenue. The other is composed, in a great
      measure, of hungry adventurers, who are too poor to buy the pleasure of
      tyranny, and are therefore attached to the only system under which they
      can enjoy it gratis. The former wish only to secure their possessions; the
      latter are desirous to perpetuate the oppressive privileges of the white
      skin. Against those privileges let us declare interminable war, war for
      ourselves, and for our children, and for our grand-children,&mdash;war
      without peace&mdash;war without truce&mdash;war without quarter! But we
      respect the rights of property as much as we detest the prerogatives of
      colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      We <span class="pagenum">328</span><a name="link328" id="link328"></a>entreat
      these respectable persons to reflect on the precarious nature of the
      tenure by which they hold their property. Even if it were in their power
      to put a stop to this controversy,&mdash;if the subject of slavery were no
      longer to occupy the attention of the British public, could they think
      themselves secure from ruin? Are no ominous signs visible in the political
      horizon? How is it that they do not discern this time? All the ancient
      fabrics of colonial empire are falling to pieces. The old equilibrium of
      power has been disturbed by the introduction of a crowd of new States into
      the system. Our West-India po-sessions are not now surrounded, as they
      formerly were, by the oppressed and impoverished colonies of a
      superannuated monarchy, in the last stage of dotage and debility, but by
      young, and vigorous, and warlike republics. We have defended our colonies
      against Spain. Does it therefore follow that we shall be able to defend
      them against Mexico or Hayti? We are told, that a pamphlet of Mr. Stephen,
      or a speech of Mr. Brougham, is sufficient to excite all the slaves in our
      colonies to rebel. What, then, would be the effect produced in Jamaica by
      the appearance of three or four Black regiments, with thirty or forty
      thousand stand of arms? The colony would be lost. Would it ever be
      recovered? Would England engage in a contest for that object, at so vast a
      distance, and in so deadly a climate? Would she not take warning by the
      fate of that mighty expedition which perished in St. Domingo? Let us
      suppose, however, that a force were sent, and that, in the field, it were
      successful. Have we forgotten how long a few Maroons defended the central
      mountains of the island against all the efforts of disciplined valour? A
      similar contest on a larger scale might be protracted for half a century,
      keeping our forces in continual employment, and depriving property of all
      its security. The country might spend fifty millions of pounds, and bury
      fifty thousand men, before the contest could be terminated. Nor is this
      all. In a servile war, the master <i>must</i> be the loser&mdash;for his
      enemies are his chattels. Whether the slave conquer or fall, he is alike
      lost to the owner. In the mean time, the soil lies uncultivated; the
      machinery is destroyed. And when the possessions of the planter are
      restored to him, they have been changed into a desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our policy is clear. If we wish to keep the Colonies, we must take prompt
      and effectual measures for raising the condition <span class="pagenum">329</span><a
      name="link329" id="link329"></a>of the slaves. We must give them
      institutions which they may have no temptation to change. We have governed
      the Canadians liberally and leniently; and the consequence is, that we can
      trust to them to defend themselves against the most formidable power that
      anywhere threatens our Colonial dominions. This is the only safeguard. You
      may renew all the atrocities of Barbadoes and Demerara. You may inflict
      all the most hateful punishments authorised by the insular codes. You may
      massacre by the thousand, and hang by the score. You may even once more
      roast your captives in slow fires, and starve them in iron cages, or flay
      them alive with the cart-whip. You will only hasten the day of
      retribution. Therefore, we say, &ldquo;Let them go forth from the house of
      bondage. For woe unto you, if you wait for the plagues and the signs, the
      wonders and the war, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the great West Indian proprietors shall persist in a different line of
      conduct, and ally themselves with the petty tyrants of the Antilles, it
      matters little. We should gladly accept of their assistance: But we feel
      assured that their opposition cannot affect the ultimate result of the
      controversy. It is not to any particular party in the church or in the
      state; it is not to the right or to the left hand of the speaker; it is
      not to the cathedral or to the Meeting, that we look exclusively for
      support. We believe that, on this subject, the hearts of the English
      People burn within them. They hate slavery. They have hated it for ages.
      If has, indeed, hidden itself for a time in a remote nook of their
      dominions: but it is now discovered and dragged to light. That is
      sufficient. Its sentence is pronounced; and it never can escape! never,
      though all the efforts of its supporters should be redoubled,&mdash;never,
      though sophistry, and falsehood, and slander, and the jests of the
      pothouse, the ribaldry of the brothel, and the slang of the ring or lives&rsquo;
      court, should do their utmost in its defence,&mdash;never, though fresh
      insurrections should be got up to frighten the people out of their
      judgment, and fresh companies to bubble them out of their money,&mdash;never,
      though it should find in the highest ranks of the peerage, or on the steps
      of the throne itself, the purveyors of its slander, and the mercenaries of
      its defence! (1)

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Since the above article was prepared for the press, we
     have met with a new and very important work on the subject
     of West-India Slavery. It is entitled, &ldquo;The <span class="pagenum">330</span><a
      name="link330" id="link330"></a>West Indies
     as they are, or a real Picture of Slavery, particularly in
     Jamaica,&rdquo; by the Rev. H. Bickell, a clergyman of the Church
     of England, who resided a considerable time in that island.
     The work is ill written; and it might have been reduced with
     advantage to half its present size. It produces, however, an
     irresistible impression of the honesty and right intentions
     of the author, who was an eyewitness of the scenes he
     describes: and it continues, in a remarkable manner, all the
     leading statements which, on the authority of Mr. Cooper,
     Dr. Williamson, and Mr. Meabing, were laid before the public
     two years ago, in the pamphlet called &ldquo;Negro Slavery.&rdquo; Mr.
     Bickell has also brought forward various new facts of the
     most damning description, in illustration both of the
     rigours of Negro bondage, and of the extraordinary
     dissoluteness of manners prevailing in Jamaica. We strongly
     recommend the work to general perusal, as a most seasonable
     antidote to those delusive tales of colonial amelioration,
     by which it has been attempted to abate the horror so
     universally felt in contemplating the cruel and debasing
     effects of the slave system.

      THE LONDON UNIVERSITY. (1)
    </h2>

      (Edinburgh, Review, February 1826.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ew <span
      class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331" id="link331"></a>things have
      ever appeared to us more inexplicable than the cry which it has pleased
      those who arrogate to themselves the exclusive praise of loyalty and
      orthodoxy, to raise against the projected University of London. In most of
      those publications which are distinguished by zeal for the Church and the
      Government, the scheme is never mentioned but with affected contempt, or
      unaffected fury. The Academic pulpits have resounded with invectives
      against it; and many even of the most liberal and enlightened members of
      the old foundations seem to contemplate it with very uncomfortable
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were startled at this. For surely no undertaking of equal importance
      was ever commenced in a manner more pacific and conciliatory. If the
      management has fallen, in a great measure, into the hands of persons whose
      political opinions are at variance with those of the dominant party, this
      was not the cause, but the effect of the jealousy which that party thought
      fit to entertain. Oxford and Cambridge, to all appearance, had nothing to
      dread. Hostilities were not declared. Even rivalry was disclaimed. The new
      Institution did not aspire to participate in the privileges which had been
      so long monopolised by those ancient corporations. It asked for no
      franchises, no lands, no advowsons. It did not interfere with that
      mysterious scale of degrees on which good churchmen look with as much
      veneration as the Patriarch on the ladder up which he saw angels
      ascending. It did not ask permission to search houses without warrants, or
      to take books from publishers without paying for them.

     (1)<i>Thoughts on the Advancement of Academical Education in
     England.</i> 1826.
</pre>
    <p>
      There <span class="pagenum">332</span><a name="link332" id="link332"></a>was
      to be no melo-dramatic pageantry, no ancient ceremonial, no silver mace,
      no gowns either black or red, no hoods either of fur or of satin, no
      public orator to make speeches which nobody hears, no oaths sworn only to
      be broken. Nobody thought of emulating the cloisters, the organs, the
      painted glass, the withered mummies, the busts of great men, and the
      pictures of naked women, which attract visitors from every part of the
      isand to the banks of Isis and Cam. The persons whose advantage was
      quietly in view belonged to a class of which very few ever find their way
      to the old colleges. The name of University was indeed assumed; and it has
      been said that this gave offence. But we are confident that so ridiculous
      an objection can have been entertained by very few. It reminds us of the
      whimsical cruelty with which Mercury, in Plautus, knocks down poor Soda
      for being so impudent as to have the same name with himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      We know indeed that there are many to whom knowledge is hateful for its
      own sake,&mdash;owl-like beings, creatures of darkness, and rapine, and
      evil omen, who are sensible that their organs fit them only for the night,&mdash;and
      that, as soon as the day arises, they shall be pecked back to their nooks
      by those on whom they now prey with impunity. By the arts of those,
      enemies of mankind, a large and influential party has been led to look
      with suspicion, if not with horror, on all schemes of education, and to
      doubt whether the ignorance of the people be not the best security for its
      virtue and repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not at present attack the principles of these persons, because we
      think that, even on those principles, they are bound to support the London
      University. If indeed it were possible to bring back, in all their ancient
      loveliness, the times of venerable absurdities and good old nuisances&mdash;if
      we could hope that gentlemen might again put their marks to deeds without
      blushing&mdash;that it might again be thought a miracle if any body in a
      parish could read, except the Vicar, or if the Vicar were to read any
      thing but the Service,&mdash;that all the literature of the multitude
      might again be comprised in a ballad or a prayer,&mdash;that the Bishop of
      Norwich might be burned for a heretic, and Sir Humphry Davy hanged for a
      conjurer,&mdash;that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might negotiate loans
      with Mr. Rothschild, by extracting <span class="pagenum">333</span><a
      name="link333" id="link333"></a>one of his teeth daily till he brought him
      to term&mdash;then indeed the case would be different. But, ala! who can
      venture to anticipate such a millennium of stupidity? The zealots of
      ignorance will therefore do well to consider, whether, since the evils of
      knowledge cannot be altogether excluded, it may not be desirable to set
      them in array against each other. The best state of things, we will
      concede to them, would be that in which all men should be dunces together.
      That might be called the age of gold. The silver age would be that in
      which no man should be taught to spell, unless he could produce letters of
      ordination, or, like a candidate for a German order of knighthood, prove
      his sixty-four quarters. Next in the scale would stand a community in
      which the higher and middling orders should be well educated, and the
      labouring people utterly uninformed. But the iron age would be that in
      which the lower classes should be rising in intelligence, while no
      corresponding improvement was taking, place in the rank immediately above
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      England is in the last of these states. From one end of the country to the
      other the artisans, the draymen, the very ploughboys, are learning to read
      and write. Thousands of them attend lectures. Hundreds of thousands read
      newspapers. Whether this be a blessing or a curse, we are not now
      inquiring. But such is the fact. Education is spreading amongst the
      working people, and cannot be prevented from spreading amongst them. The
      change which has taken place in this respect within twenty years is
      prodigious. No person surely, will venture to say that information has
      increased in the same degree amongst those who constitute what may be
      called the lower part of the middling class,&mdash;farmers for instance,
      shopkeepers, or clerks in commercial houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be any truth in the principles held by the enemies of education,
      this is the most dangerous state in which a country can be placed. They
      maintain that knowledge renders the poor arrogant and discontented. It
      will hardly be disputed, we presume, that arrogance is the result, not of
      the absolute situation in which a man may be placed, but of the relation
      in which he stands to others. Where a whole society is equably rising in
      intelligence; where the distance between its different orders remains the
      same, though every order advances, that feeling is not likely to be
      excited. An individual <span class="pagenum">334</span><a name="link334"
       id="link334"></a>is not more vain of his knowledge, because he
      participates in the universal improvement, than he is vain of his speed,
      because he is dying along with the earth and every thing upon it, at the
      rate of seventy thousand miles an hour. But if he feels that <i>he</i> is
      going forward, while those before him are standing still, the case is
      altered. If ever the diffusion of knowledge can be attended with the
      danger of which we hear so much, it is in England at the present moment.
      And this danger can be obviated in two ways only. Unteach the pool-,&mdash;or
      teach those who may, by comparison, be called the rich. The former it is
      plainly impossible to do: And therefore, if those whom we are addressing
      be consistent, they will exert themselves to do the latter; and, by
      increasing the knowledge, increase also the power of an extensive and
      important class,&mdash;a class which is as deeply interested as the
      peerage or the hierarchy in the prosperity and tranquillity of the
      country; a class which, while it is too numerous to be corrupted by
      government, is too intelligent to be duped by demagogues, and which,
      though naturally hostile to oppression and profusion, is not likely to
      carry its zeal for reform to lengths inconsistent with the security of
      property and the maintenance of social order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But an University without religion!&rdquo; softly expostulates the Quarterly
      Review.&mdash;&ldquo;An University without religion!&rdquo; roars John Bull, wedging
      in his pious horror between a slander and a double-entendre. And from
      pulpits and visitation-dinners and combination-rooms innumerable, the cry
      is echoed and re-echoed, &ldquo;An University without religion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This objection has really imposed on many excellent people, who have not
      adverted to the immense difference which exists between the new
      Institution and those foundations of which the members form a sort of
      family, living under the same roof, governed by the same regulations,
      compelled to eat at the same table, and to return to their apartments at
      the same hours. Have none of those who censure the London University on
      this account, daughters who are educated at home, and who are attended by
      different teachers? The music-master, a good Protestant, comes at twelve;
      the dancing-master, a French philosopher, at two; the Italian master, a
      believer in the blood of Saint Januarius, at three. The parents take upon
      themselves the office of instructing their child in religion. She hears
      the preachers whom they prefer, <span class="pagenum">335</span><a
      name="link335" id="link335"></a>and reads the theological works which they
      put into her hands. Who can deny that this is the case in innumerable
      families? Who can point ont any material difference between the situation
      in which this girl is placed, and that of a pupil at the new University?
      Why then is so crying an abuse suffered to exist without reprehension? Is
      there no Sacheverell to raise the old cry,&mdash;the Church is in danger,&mdash;that
      cry which was never uttered by any voice however feeble., or for any end
      however base, without being instantly caught up and repeated through all
      the dark and loathsome nooks where bigotry nestles with corruption? Where
      is the charge of the Bishop and the sermon of the Chaplain, the tear of
      the Chancellor and the oath of the Heir-apparent, the speech of Mr.
      William Bankes and the pamphlet of Sir Harcourt Lees? What means the
      silence of those filthy and malignant baboons, whose favourite diversion
      is to grin and sputter at innocence and beauty through the grates of their
      spunging-houses? Why not attempt to blast the reputation of the poor
      ladies who are so irreligiously brought up? Why not search into all the
      secrets of their families? Why not enliven the Sunday breakfast-tables of
      priests and placemen with elopements of their great-aunts and the
      bankruptcies of their second cousins?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, to make the parallel still clearer, take the case of a young man, a
      student, we will suppose, of surgery, resident in London. He wishes to
      become master of his profession, without neglecting other useful branches
      of knowledge. In the morning he attends Mr. M&rsquo;Culloch&rsquo;s lecture on
      Political Economy. He then repairs to the Hospital, and hears Sir Astley
      Cooper explain the mode of reducing fractures. In the afternoon he joins
      one of the classes which Mr. Hamilton instructs in French or German. With
      regard to religions observances, he acts as he himself, or those under
      whose care he is, may think most advisable. Is there any thing
      objectionable in this? Is it not the most common case in the world? And in
      what does it differ from that of a young man at the London University? Our
      surgeon, it is true, will have to run over half London in search of his
      instructors; and the other will find all the lecture-rooms which he
      attends standing conveniently together, at the end of Gower Street. Is it
      in the local situation that the mischief lies? We have observed that,
      since Mr. Croker, in the last session of <span class="pagenum">336</span><a
      name="link336" id="link336"></a>Parliament, declared himself ignorant of
      the site of Russell Square, the plan of forming an University in so
      inelegant a neighbourhood has excited much contempt amongst those
      estimable persons who think that the whole dignity of man consists in
      living within certain districts, wearing coats made by certain tailors,
      and eschewing certain meats and drinks. We should be sorry to think that
      the reports which any lying Mandeville from Bond Street may have
      circulated respecting that Terra Incognita, could seriously prejudice the
      new College. The Secretary of the Admiralty, however, has the remedy in
      his own hands. When Captain Franklin returns, as we trust he soon will,
      from his American expedition, he will, we hope, he sent to explore that
      other North-West passage which connects the city with the Regent&rsquo;s Park.
      It would then be found, that, though the natives generally belong to the
      same race with those Oriental barbarians whose irruptions have long been
      the terror of Hamilton Place and Grosvenor Square, they are, upon the
      whole, quiet and inoffensive; that, though they possess no architectural
      monument which can be compared to the Pavilion at Brighton, their
      habitations are neat and commodious; and that their language has many
      roots in common with that which is spoken in St. James&rsquo;s Street. One thing
      more we must mention, which will astonish some of our readers, as much as
      the discovery of the Syrian Christians of St. Thomas on the coast of
      Malabar. Our religion has been introduced by some Xavier or Augustin of
      former times into these tracts. Churches, with all their appurtenances of
      hassocks and organs, are to be found there; and even the tithe, that great
      <i>articulum stantis aut lahantis ecclesiae</i>, is by no means unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer of the article on this subject in the last Number of the
      Quarterly Review, severely censures the omission of religious instruction,
      in a place styling itself an University,&mdash;never perceiving that, with
      the inconsistency which belongs to error, he has already answered the
      objection. &ldquo;A place of education,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is the least of all proper to
      be made the arena of disputable and untried doctrine.&rdquo; He severely
      censures those academies in which &ldquo;a perpetual vacillation of doctrine is
      observable, whether in morals, metaphysics, or religion, according to the
      frequency of change in the professional chair.&rdquo; Now, we venture to say,
      that these <span class="pagenum">337</span><a name="link337" id="link337"></a>considerations,
      if they are worth any thing at all, are decisive against any scheme of
      religions instruction in the London University. That University was
      intended to admit not only Christians of all persuasions, but even Jews.
      But suppose that it were to narrow its limits, to adopt the formularies of
      the Church of England, to require subscription, or the sacramental test,
      from every professor and from every pupil; still, we say, there would be
      more field for controversy, more danger of that vacillation of doctrine
      which seems to the Reviewer to be so great an evil, on subjects of
      theology, than on all other subjects together. Take a science which is
      still young, a science of considerable intricacy, a science, we may add,
      which the passions and interests of men have rendered more intricate than
      it is in its own nature, the science of Political Economy. Who will deny,
      that, for one schism which is to be found among those who are engaged in
      that study, there are twenty on points of divinity, <i>within the Church
      of England?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not notorious that Arminiens, who stand on the very frontier of
      Pelagianism, and Calvinists, whom a line scarcely discernible separates
      from Antinomianism, are to be found among those who eat the bread of the
      Establishment? Is it not notorious that predestination, final
      perseverance, the operation of grace, the efficacy of the sacraments, and
      a hundred other subjects which we could name, have been themes of violent
      disputes between eminent churchmen? The ethics of Christianity, as well as
      its theory, have been the theme of dispute. One party calls the other
      latitudinarian and worldly. The other retorts accusations of fanaticism
      and asceticism. The curate has been set against the rector, the dean
      against the bishop. There is scarcely a parish in England into which the
      controversy has not found its way. There is scarcely an action of human
      life so trivial and familiar as not to be in some way or other affected by
      it. Whether it is proper to take in a Sunday newspaper, to shoot a
      partridge, to course a hare, to subscribe to a Bible Society, to dance, to
      play at whist, to read Tom Jones, to see Othello,&mdash;all these are
      questions on which the strongest difference of opinion exists between
      persons of high eminence in the hierarchy. The Quarterly Reviewer thinks
      it a very bad thing, that &ldquo;the first object of a new professor should be
      to refute the fundamental positions of his predecessors.&rdquo; What would be
      <span class="pagenum">338</span><a name="link338" id="link338"></a>the
      case if a High Churchman should succeed a Low Churchman, or a Low
      Churchman a High Churchman, in the chair of religion? And what possible
      security could the London University have against such an event? What
      security have Oxford or Cambridge now? In fact, all that we know of the
      state of religious parties at those place, fully bears out our statement.
      One of the most famous divines of our time. Dr. Marsh, Bishop of
      Peterborough, Margaret Professor of Theology at Cambridge, and author of
      eighty-seven of the most unanswerable questions that ever man propounded
      to his fellow-men, published a very singular hypothesis respecting the
      origin of the Gospels. With the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis we
      have nothing to do. We have, however, heard another eminent Professor of
      the same University, high in the Church, condemn the theory as utterly
      unfounded, and of most dangerous consequence to the orthodox faith. Nay,
      the very pulpit of Saint Mary&rsquo;s has been &ldquo;the arena of disputable and
      untried doctrine,&rdquo; as much as ever was the chair of any Scotch or German
      professor,&mdash;a fact, of which any person may easily satisfy himself,
      who will take the trouble to rescue from the hands of trunk-makers and
      pastry-cooks, a few of the sermons which have been preached there, and
      subsequently published. And if, in the course of his researches, he should
      happen to light on that which was preached by a very eminent scholar on a
      very remarkable occasion, the installation of the Duke Gloucester, he will
      see, that not only dispute, but something very like abuse, may take place
      between those whose office it is to instruct our young collegians in the
      doctrines and duties of Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;would it not be shocking to expose the morals of young
      men to the contaminating influence of a great city, to all the
      fascinations of the Fives&rsquo; Court and the gaming table, the tavern and the
      saloon?&rdquo; Shocking, indeed, we grant, if it were possible to send them all
      to Oxford and Cambridge, those blessed spots where, to use the imagery of
      their own prize-poems, the Saturnian age still lingers, and where
      white-robed Innocence has left the print of her departing footsteps.
      There, we know, all the men are philosophers, and all the women vestals.
      There, simple and bloodless repasts support the body without distressing
      the mind. There, while the sluggish world is still sleeping, the ingenious
      <span class="pagenum">339</span><a name="link339" id="link339"></a>youth
      hasten to pour forth their fervent orisons in the chapel; and in the
      evening, elsewhere the season of riot and license, indulge themselves with
      a solitary walk beneath the venerable avenues, musing on the vanity of
      sensual pursuits, and the eternity and sublimity of virtue. But, alas!
      these blissful abodes of the Seven Cardinal Virtues are neither large
      enough nor cheap enough for those who stand in need of instruction. Many
      thousands of young men will live in London, whether an University be
      established there or not,&mdash;and that for this simple reason, that they
      cannot afford to live elsewhere. That they should be condemned to one
      misfortune because they labour under another, and debarred from knowledge
      because they are surrounded with temptations to vice, seems to be not a
      very rational or humane mode of proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      To speak seriously, in comparing the dangers to which the morals of young
      men are exposed in London, with those which exist at the Universities,
      there is something to be said on both sides. The temptations of London may
      be greater. But with the temptation there is a way to escape. If the
      student live with his family, he will be under the influence of restraints
      more powerful, and, we will add, infinitely more salutary and respectable,
      than those which the best disciplined colleges can impose. Even if he be
      left completely to his own devices, he will still have within his reach
      two inestimable advantages, from which the students of Oxford and
      Cambridge are almost wholly excluded, the society of men older than
      himself, and of modest women.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no intimacies more valuable than those which a young man forms
      with one who is his senior by ten or twelve years. Those years do not
      destroy the sympathy and the sense of equality without which no cordiality
      can exist. Yet they strengthen the principles, and form the judgment. They
      make one of the parties a sensible adviser, and the other a docile
      listener. Such friendships it is almost impossible to form at College.
      Between the man of twenty and the man of thirty there is a great gulf, a
      distinction which cannot be mistaken, which is marked by the dress and by
      the seat, at prayers and at table. We do not believe that, of the young
      students at our ancient seats of learning, one in ten lives in confidence
      and familiarity with any member of the University who is a Master of Arts.
      When the members of <span class="pagenum">340</span><a name="link340"
       id="link340"></a>the University are deducted, the society of Oxford and
      Cambridge is no more than that of an ordinary county town.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state of things, it is clear, does more harm than all the exertions
      of Proctors and Proproctors can do good. The errors of young men are of a
      nature with which it is very difficult to deal. Slight punishments are
      inefficient; severe punishments generally and justly odious. The best
      course is to give them over to the arm of public opinion. To restrain
      them, it is necessary to make them discreditable. But how can they be made
      discreditable while the offenders associate only with those who are of the
      same age, who are exposed to the same temptations, and who are willing to
      grant the indulgence which they themselves may need? It is utterly
      impossible that a code of morality and honour, enacted by the young only,
      can be so severe against juvenile irregularities as that which is in force
      in general society, where manhood and ape have the deciding voice, and
      where the partial inclinations of those whose passions are strong, and
      whose reason is weak, are withstood by those whom time and domestic life
      have sobered. The difference resembles that which would be found between
      laws passed by an assembly consisting solely of farmers, or solely of
      weavers, and those of a senate fairly representing every interest of the
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      A student in London, even though he may not live with his own relatives,
      will generally have it in his power to mix with respectable female
      society. This is not only a very pleasant thing, but it is one which,
      though it may not make him moral, is likely to make him decorous, and to
      preserve him from that brainless and heartless Yahooism, that disdain of
      the character of women, and that brutal indifference to their misery,
      which is the worst offence, and the severest punishment of the finished
      libertine. Many of the pupils will, in all probability, continue to reside
      with their parents or friends. We own that we can conceive no situation
      more agreeable or more salutary. One of the worst effects of College
      habits is that distaste for domestic life which they almost inevitably
      generate. The system is monastic; and it tends to produce the monastic
      selfishness, inattention to the convenience of others, and impatience of
      petty privations. We mean no reproach. It is utterly impossible that the
      most amiable man in the world can be accustomed to live for <span
      class="pagenum">341</span><a name="link341" id="link341"></a>years
      independent of his neighbours, and to lay all his plans with a view only
      to himself, without becoming, in some degree, unfitted for a family. A
      course of education which should combine the enjoyments of a home with the
      excitements of a University, would be more likely than any other to form
      characters at once affectionate and manly. Homebred boys, it is often
      said, are idle. The cause, we suspect, is the want of competitors. We no
      more believe that a young man at the London University would be made idle
      by the society of his mothers and sisters, than that the old German
      warriors, or the combatants in the tournaments of the middle ages, were
      made cowards by the presence of female spectators. On the contrary, we are
      convinced that his ambition would be at once animated and consecrated by
      daily intercourse with those who would be dearest to him, and most
      inclined to rejoice in his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eulogists of the old Universities are fond of dwelling on the glorious
      associations connected with them. It has often been said that the young
      scholar is likely to catch a generous enthusiasm from looking upon spots
      ennobled by so many great names&mdash;that he can scarcely see the chair
      in which Bentley sat, the tree which Alilton planted, the wadis within
      which Wickliffe presided, the books illustrated by the autographs of
      famous men, the halls hung with their pictures, the chapels hallowed by
      their tombs, without aspiring to imitate those whom he admires. Far be it
      from us to speak with disrespect of such feelings. It is possible that the
      memorials of those who have asserted the freedom, and extended the empire
      of the mind, may produce a strong impression on a sensitive and ardent
      disposition. But these instances are rare. &ldquo;Coram Lepidis male vivitur.&rdquo;
       Young academicians venture to get drunk within a few yards of the grave of
      Newton, and to commit solecisms, though the awful eye of Erasmus frowns
      upon them from the canvas. Some more homely sentiment, some more obvious
      association is necessary. For our part, when a young man is to be urged to
      persevering industry, and fortified against the seductions of pleasure, we
      would rather send him to the fireside of his own family, than to the
      abodes of philosophers who died centuries ago,&mdash;and to those kind
      familiar faces which are always anxious in his anxiety, and joyful in his
      success, than to the portrait of any waiter that ever wore cap and gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">342</span><a name="link342" id="link342"></a>cry
      against the London University lias been swelled by the voices of many
      really conscientious persons. Many have joined in it from the mere wanton
      love of mischief. But we believe that it has principally originated in the
      jealousy of those who are attached to Cambridge and Oxford, either by
      their interests, or by those feelings which men naturally entertain
      towards the place of their education, and which, when they do not
      interfere with schemes of public advantage, are entitled to respect. Many
      of these persons, we suspect, entertain a vague apprehension, scarcely
      avowed even to themselves, that some defects in the constitution of their
      favourite Academies will be rendered more glaring by the contrast which
      the system of this new College will exhibit.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there are such defects, great and radical defects in the structure of
      the two Universities, we are strongly inclined to believe: and the
      jealousy which many of their members have expressed of the new Institution
      greatly strengthens our opinion. What those defects appear to us to be, we
      shall attempt to state with frankness, but, at the same time, we trust,
      with candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are sensible that we have undertaken a dangerous task. There is perhaps
      no subject on which more people have made up their minds without knowing
      why. Whenever this is the case, discussion ends in scurrility, the last
      resource of the disputant who cannot answer, and who will not submit. The
      scurrility of those who are scurrilous on all occasions, and against all
      opponents, by nature and by habit, by taste and by trade, can excite only
      the mirth or the pity of a well regulated mind. But we neither posess, nor
      affect to possess, that degree of philosophy, which would render us
      indifferent to the pain and resentment of sincere and respectable persons,
      whose prejudices we are compelled to assail. It is not in the bitterness
      of party spirit, it is not in the wantonness of paradox and declamation,
      that we would put to hazard the good will of learned and estimable men.
      Such a sacrifice must be powerful, and nothing but a sense of public duty
      would lead us to make it. We would earnestly entreat the admirers of the
      two Universities to reflect on the importance of this subject, the
      advantages of calm investigation, and the folly of trusting, in an age
      like the present, to mere dogmatism and invective. If the system which
      <span class="pagenum">343</span><a name="link343" id="link343"></a>they
      love and venerate rest upon just principles, the examination which we
      propose to institute, into the state of its foundations, can only serve to
      prove their solidity. If they be unsound, we will not permit ourselves to
      think, that intelligent and honourable men can wish to disguise a fact
      which, for the sake of this country, and of the whole human race, ought to
      be widely known. Let them, instead of reiterating assertions which leave
      the question exactly where they found it; instead of turning away from all
      argument, as if the subject were one on which doubt partook of the nature
      of sin; instead of attributing to selfishness or malevolence, that which
      may at worst be harmless error, join us in coolly studying so interesting
      and momentous a point.&mdash;As to this, however, they will please
      themselves. We speak to the English people. The public mind, if we are not
      deceived, is approaching to manhood. It has outgrown its swaddling-bands,
      and thrown away its play-things. It can no longer be amused by a rattle,
      or laid asleep by a song, or awed by a fairy tale. At such a time, we
      cannot doubt that we shall obtain an impartial hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our objections to Oxford and Cambridge may be summed up in two words,
      their Wealth and their Privileges. Their prosperity does not depend on the
      public approbation. It would therefore be strange if they deserved the
      public approbation. Their revenues are immense. Their degrees are, in some
      professions, indispensable. Like manufacturers who enjoy a monopoly, they
      work at such an advantage, that they can venture to work ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every person, we presume, will acknowledge that, to establish an academic
      system on immutable principles, would be the height of absurdity. Every
      year sees the empire of science enlarged by the acquisition of some new
      province, or improved by the construction of some easier road. Surely the
      change which daily takes place in the state of knowledge, ought to be
      accompanied by a corresponding change in the method of instruction. In
      many cases the rude and imperfect works of early speculators ought to give
      place to the more complete and luminous performances of those who succeed
      them. Even the comparative value of languages is subject to great
      fluctuations. The same tongue which at one period may be richer than any
      other in valuable works, may, some centuries after, be poorer than any.
      That, while such revolutions <span class="pagenum">344</span><a
      name="link344" id="link344"></a>take place, education ought to remain
      unchanged, is a proposition too absurd to be maintained for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it be desirable that education should, by a gradual and constant
      change, adapt itself to the circumstances of every generation, how is this
      object to be secured? We answer&mdash;only by perfect freedom of
      competition. Under such a system, every possible exigence would be met.
      Whatever language, whatever art, whatever science, it might at any time be
      useful to know, <i>that</i>, men would surely learn, and woidd as surely
      find instructors to teach. The professor who should persist in devoting
      his attention to branches of knowledge which had become useless, would
      soon be deserted by his pupils. There would be as much of every sort of
      information as would afford profit and pleasure to the possessor&mdash;and
      no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the riches and the franchises of our Universities prevent this
      salutary rivalry from taking place. In its stead is introduced an
      unnatural system of premiums, prohibitions, and apprenticeships. Enormous
      bounties are lavished on particular acquirements; and, in consequence,
      there is among our youth a glut of Greek, Latin, and Mathematics, and a
      lamentable scarcity of every thing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are by no means inclined to depreciate the studies which are encouraged
      at Oxford and Cambridge. We should reprobate with the same severity a
      system tinder which a like exclusive protection should be extended to
      French or Spanish, Chemistry or Mineralogy, Metaphysics or Political
      Economy. Some of these branches of knowledge are very important. But they
      may not always be equally important. Five hundred years hence, the Burmese
      language may contain the most valuable books in the world. Sciences, for
      which there is now no name, and of which the first rudiments are still
      undiscovered, may then be in the greatest demand. Our objection is to the
      principle. We abhor intellectual perpetuities. A chartered and endowed
      College, strong in its wealth and in its degrees, does not find it
      necessary to teach what is useful, because it can pay men to learn what is
      useless. Every fashion which was in vogue at the time of its foundation,
      enters into its constitution and partakes of its immortality. Its abuses
      savour of the reality, and its prejudices vest in mortmain, with its
      lands. In the present instance, the consequences are notorious. We every
      day see clever <span class="pagenum">345</span><a name="link345"
       id="link345"></a>men of four and five-and-twenty, loaded with academical
      honours and rewards,&mdash;-scholarships, fellowships, whole cabinets of
      medals, whole shelves of prize books,&mdash;enter into life with their
      education still to begin, unacquainted with the history, the literature,
      we might almost say, the language of their country, unacquainted with the
      first principles of the laws under which they live, unacquainted with the
      very rudiments of moral and political science! Who will deny that this is
      the state of things? Or who will venture to defend it?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is no new complaint. Long before society had so far outstripped the
      Colleges in the career of improvement as it has since done, the evil was
      noticed and traced to its true cause, by that great philosopher who most
      accurately mapped all the regions of science, and furnished the human
      intellect with its most complete Itinerary. &ldquo;It is not to be forgotten,&rdquo;
       says Lord Bacon, &ldquo;that the dedicating of foundations and donations to
      professory learning, hath not only had a malign influence upon the growth
      of sciences, but hath also been prejudicial to states and governments: For
      hence it proceed-eth, that princes find a solitude in respect of able men
      to serve them in causes of state, <i>because there is no education
      collegiate which is free</i>, where such as were so disposed might give
      themselves to histories, modern languages, books of policy and civil
      discourse, and other like enablements unto causes of state.&rdquo; The warmest
      admirers of the present system will hardly deny, that, if this was an evil
      in the sixteenth century, it must be a much greater evil in the
      nineteenth. The literature of Greece and Rome is now what it was then.
      That of every modern language has received considerable accessions. And
      surely, &ldquo;books of policy and civil discourse&rdquo; are as important to an
      English gentleman of the present day, as they could be to a subject of
      James the First.
    </p>
    <p>
      We repeat, that we are not disparaging either the dead languages or the
      exact sciences. We only say, that if they are useful they will not need
      peculiar encouragement, and that, if they are useless, they ought not to
      receive it. Those who maintain that the present system is necessary to
      promote the study of classical and mathematical knowledge, are the persons
      who really depreciate those pursuits. They do in (1) Advancement of
      Learning, Book II.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact <span class="pagenum">346</span><a name="link346" id="link346"></a>declare,
      by implication, that neither amusement nor profit is to be derived from
      them, and that no man has any motive to employ his time upon them, unless
      he expects that they may help him to a fellowship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The utility of mathematical knowledge is felt in every part of the system
      of life, and acknowledged by every rational man. But does it therefore
      follow, that people ought to be paid to acquire it. A scarcity of persons
      capable of making almanacks and measuring land, is as little to be
      apprehended as a scarcity of blacksmiths. In fact, very few of our
      academical mathematicians turn their knowledge to such practical purposes.
      There are many wranglers who have never touched a quadrant. What peculiar
      title then has the mere speculative knowledge of mathematical truth to
      such costly remuneration? The answer is well known. It makes men good
      reasoners: it habituates them to strict accuracy in drawing inferences. In
      this statement there is unquestionably some truth. A man who understands
      the nature of mathematical reasoning, the closest of all kinds of
      reasoning, is likely to reason better than another on points not
      mathematical, as a man who can dance generally walks better than a man who
      cannot.. But no people walk so ill as dancing-masters, and no people
      reason so ill as mere mathematicians. They are accustomed to look only for
      one species of evidence; a species of evidence of which the transactions
      of life do not admit. When they come from certainties to probabilities,
      from a syllogism to a witness, their superiority is at an end. They
      resemble a man who, never having seen any object which was not either
      black or white, should be required to discriminate between two near shades
      of grey. Hence, on questions of religion, policy, or common life, we
      perpetually see these boasted demonstrators either extravagantly
      credulous, or extravagantly sceptical. That the science is a necessary
      ingredient in a liberal education, we admit. But it is only an ingredient,
      and an ingredient which is peculiarly dangerous, unless diluted by a large
      admixture of others. To encourage it by such rewards as are bestowed at
      Cambridge, is to make the occasional tonic of the mind its morning and
      evening nutriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partisans of classical literature are both more numerous and more
      enthusiastic than the mathematicians; and the ignorant violence with which
      their cause has sometimes been assailed, <span class="pagenum">347</span><a
      name="link347" id="link347"></a>has added to its popularity. On this
      subject we are sure that we are at least impartial judges. We feel the
      warmest admiration for the great remains of antiquity. We gratefully
      acknowledge the benefits which mankind has owed to them. But we would no
      more sutler a pernicious system to be protected by the reverence which is
      due to them, than we would show our reverence for a saint by erecting his
      shrine into a sanctuary for criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      An eloquent scholar has said, that ancient literature was the ark in which
      all the civilization of the world was preserved during the deluge of
      barbarism. We confess it. But we do not read that Noah thought himself
      bound to live in the ark after the deluge had subsided. When our ancestors
      first began to consider the study of the classics as the principal part of
      education, little or nothing worth reading was to be found in any modern
      language. Circumstances have confessedly changed. Is it not possible that
      a change of system may be desirable?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our opinion of the Latin tongue will, we fear, be considered heretical. We
      cannot but think that its vocabulary is miserably poor, and its mechanism
      deficient both in power and precision. The want of a definite article, and
      of a distinction between the preterite and the aorist tenses, are two
      defects which are alone sufficient to place it below any other language
      with which we are acquainted. In its most flourishing era it was
      reproached with poverty of expression. Cicero, indeed, was induced, by his
      patriotic feelings to deny the charge. But the perpetual recurrence of
      Greek words in his most hurried and familiar letters, and the frequent use
      which he is compelled to make of them, in spite of all his exertions to
      avoid them, in his philosophical works, fully prove that even this great
      master of the Latin tongue felt the evil which he laboured to conceal from
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not think much better of the writers, as a body, than of the
      language. The literature of Rome was born old. All the signs of
      decrepitude were on it in the cradle. We look in vain for the sweet lisp
      and the graceful wildness of an infant dialect. We look in vain for a
      single great creative mind,&mdash;for a Homer or a Dante, a Shakspeare or
      a Cervantes. In their place we have a crowd of fourth-rate and fifth-rate
      authors, translators, and imitators without end. The rich heritage of
      Grecian philosophy and poetry was fatal <span class="pagenum">348</span><a
      name="link348" id="link348"></a>to the Romans. They would have acquired
      more wealth, if they had succeeded to less. Instead of accumulating fresh
      intellectual treasures, they contented themselves with enjoying, disposing
      in new forms, or impairing by an injudicious management, those which they
      took by descent. Hence, in most of their works, there is scarcely any
      thing spontaneous and racy, scarcely any originality in the thoughts,
      scarcely any idiom in the style. Their poetry tastes of the hot-house. It
      is trail-planted from Greece, with the earth of Pindus clinging round its
      roots. It is nursed in careful seclusion from the Italian air. The
      gardeners are often skilful; but the fruit is almost always sickly. One
      hardy and prickly shrub, of genuine Latin growth, must indeed be excepted.
      Satire was the only indigenous produce of Roman talent; and, in our
      judgment, by far the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are often told the Latin language is more strictly grammatical than the
      English; and that it is, therefore, necessary to study it, in order to
      speak English with elegance and accuracy. This is one of those remarks
      which are repeated till they pass into axioms, only because they have so
      little meaning, that nobody thinks it worth while to refute them at their
      first appearance. If those who say that the Latin language is more
      strictly grammatical than the English, mean only that it is more regular,
      that there are fewer exceptions to its general laws of derivation,
      inflection, and construction, we grant it. This is, at least for the
      purposes of the orator and the poet, rather a defect than a merit; but be
      it merit or defect, it can in no possible way facilitate the acquisition
      of any other language. It would be about as reasonable to say, that the
      simplicity of the Code Napoleon renders the study of the laws of England
      easier than formerly. If it be meant, that the Latin language is formed in
      more strict accordance with the general principles of grammar than the
      English, that is to say, that the relations which words bear to each other
      are more strictly analogous to the relations between the ideas which they
      represent in Latin than in English, we venture to doubt the fact. We are
      quite sure, that not one in ten thousand of those who repeat the hackneyed
      remark on which we are commenting, have ever considered whether there be
      any principles of grammar whatever, anterior to positive enactment,&mdash;any
      solecism which is a <i>malum in se</i>, as distinct from a <i>malum
      prohibitum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, if <span class="pagenum">349</span><a name="link349" id="link349"></a>we
      suppose that there exist such principles, is not the circumstance, that a
      particular rule is found in one language and not in another, a sufficient
      proof that it is not one of those principles? That a man who knows Latin
      is likely to know English better than one who does not, we do not dispute.
      But this advantage is not peculiar to the study of Latin. Every language
      throws light on every other. There is not a single foreign tongue which
      will not suggest to a man of sense some new considerations respecting his
      own. We acknowledge, too, that the great body of our educated countrymen
      learn to grammatieise their English by means of their Latin. This,
      however, proves, not the usefulness of their Latin, but the folly of their
      other instructors. Instead of being a vindication of the present system of
      education, it is a high charge against it. A man who thinks the knowledge
      of Latin essential to the purity of English diction, either has never
      conversed with an accomplished woman, or does not deserve to have
      conversed with her. We are sure, that all persons who are in the habit of
      hearing public speaking must have observed, that the orators who are
      fondest of quoting Latin, are by no means the most scrupulous about
      marring their native tongue. We could mention several Members of
      Parliament, who never fail to usher in their scraps of Horace and Juvenal
      with half a dozen false con cords.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Latin language is principally valuable as an introduction to the
      Greek, the insignificant portico of a most chaste and majestic fabric. On
      this subject, our Confession of Faith will, we trust, be approved by the
      most orthodox scholar. We cannot refuse our admiration to that most
      wonderful and perfect machine of human thought, to the flexibility, the
      harmony, the gigantic power, the exquisite delicacy, the infinite wealth
      of words, the incomparable felicity of expression, in which are united the
      energy of the English, the neatness of the French, the sweet and infantine
      simplicity of the Tuscan. Of all dialects, it is the best fitted for the
      purposes both of science and of elegant literature. The philosophical
      vocabularies of ancient Rome, and of modern Europe, have been derived from
      that of Athens. Yet none of the imitations has ever approached the
      richness and precision of the original. It traces with ease distinctions
      so subtle, as to be lost in every other language. It draws lines where all
      the other instruments <span class="pagenum">350</span><a name="link350"
       id="link350"></a>of the reason only make blots. Nor is it less
      distinguished by the facilities which it affords to the poet. There are
      pages even in the Greek Dictionaries over which it is impossible to glance
      without delight. Every word suggests some pleasant or striking image,
      which, wholly unconnected as it is with that which precedes or that which
      follows, gives the same, sort of pleasure with that which we derive from
      reading the Adonais of poor Shelley, or from looking at those elegant,
      though unmeaning friezes, in which the eye wanders along a line of
      beautiful faces, graceful draperies, stags, chariots, altars, and
      garlands. The literature is not unworthy of the language. It may boast of
      four poets of the very first order, Homer, Æschylus. Sophocles, and
      Aristophanes,&mdash;of Demosthenes, the greatest of orators&mdash;of
      Aristotle, who is perhaps entitled to the same rank among philosophers,
      and of Plato, who, if not the most satisfactory of philosophers, is at
      least the most fascinating. These are the great names of Greece; and to
      these is to be added a long list of ingenious moralists, wits, and
      rhetoricians, of poets who, in the lower departments of their art, deserve
      the greatest praise, and of historians who, at least in the talent of
      narration, have never been equalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was justly said by the Emperor Charles the Fifth, that to learn a new
      language was to acquire a new soul. He who is acquainted only with the
      writers of his native tongue, is in perpetual danger of confounding what
      is accidental with what is essential, and of supposing that tastes and
      habits of thought, which belong only to his own age and country, are
      inseparable from the nature of man. Initiated into foreign literature, he
      finds that principles of politics and morals, directly contrary to those
      which he has hitherto supposed to be unquestionable, because he never
      heard them questioned, have been held by large and enlightened
      communities; that feelings, which are so universal among his
      contemporaries, that he had supposed them instinctive, have been unknown
      to whole generations; that images, which have never failed to excite the
      ridicule of those among whom he has lived, have been thought sublime by
      millions. He thus loses that Chinese cast of mind, that stupid contempt
      for every thing beyond the wall of his celestial empire, which was the
      effect of his former ignorance. New associations take place among his
      ideas. He doubts where he formerly dogmatised. He tolerates <span
      class="pagenum">351</span><a name="link351" id="link351"></a>where he
      formerly execrated. He ceases to confound that which is universal and
      eternal in human passions and opinions with that which is local and
      temporary. This is one of the most useful effects which results from
      studying the literature of other countries; and it is one which the
      remains of Greece, composed at a remote period, and in a state of society
      widely different from our own, are peculiarly calculated to produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though we are sensible that great advantages may be derived from the
      study of the Greek language, we think that they may be purchased at too
      high a price: And we think that seven or eight years of the life of a man
      who is to enter into active life at two or three-and-twenty, is too high a
      price. Those are bad economists who look only to the excellence of the
      article for which they are bargaining, and never ask about the cost. The
      cost, in the present instance, is too often the whole of that invaluable
      portion of time during which a fund of intellectual pleasure is to be
      stored up and the foundations of wisdom and usefulness laid. No person
      doubts that much knowledge may be obtained from the Classics. It is
      equally certain that much gold may be found in Spain. But it by no moans
      necessarily follows, that it is wise to work the Spanish mines, or to
      learn the ancient languages. Before the voyage of Columbus, Spain supplied
      all Europe with the precious metals. The discovery of America changed the
      state of things. New mines were found, from which gold could be procured
      in greater plenty, and with less labour. The old works were therefore
      abandoned&mdash;it being manifest those who persisted in laying out
      capital on them would be undersold and ruined. A new world of literature
      and science has also been discovered. New veins of intellectual wealth
      have been laid open. But a monstrous system of bounties and prohibitions
      compels us still to go on delving for a few glittering grains in the dark
      and laborious shaft of antiquity, instead of penetrating a district which
      would reward a less painful search with a more lucrative return. If, after
      the conquest of Pern, Spain had enacted that, in order to enable the old
      mines to maintain a competition against the new, a hundred pistoles should
      be given to every person who should extract an ounce of gold from them,
      the parallel would be complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will admit that the Greek language is a more valuable language <span
      class="pagenum">352</span><a name="link352" id="link352"></a>than the
      French, the Italian, or the Spanish. But whether it be more valuable than
      all the three together, may be doubted; and that all the three may be
      acquired in less than half the time in which it is possible to become
      thoroughly acquainted with the Greek, admits of no doubt at all. Nor does
      the evil end here. Not only do the modern dialects of the Continent
      receive less attention than they deserve, but our own tongue, second to
      that of Greece alone in force and copiousness, our own literature, second
      to none that ever existed, so rich in poetry, in eloquence, in philosophy,
      is unpardonably neglected. All the nineteen plays of Euripides are
      digested, from the first bubbling froth of the Hecuba to the last vapid
      dregs of the Electra; while our own sweet Fletcher, the second name of the
      modern drama, in spite of all the brilliancy of his wit, and all the
      luxury of his tenderness, is suffered to be neglected. The Essay on the
      Human Understanding is abandoned for the Theotetus and the Phoedon. We
      have known the dates of all the petty skirmisher, of the Peloponnesian war
      carefully transcribed and committed to memory, by a man who thought that
      Hyde and Clarendon were two different persons! That such a man has paid a
      dear price for his learning, will be admitted. But, it may be said, he has
      at least something to show for it. Unhappily he has sacrificed, in order
      to acquire it, the very things without which it was impossible for him to
      use it. He has acted like a man living in a small lodging, who, instead of
      spending his money in enlarging his apartments and fitting them up
      commodiously, should lay it all out on furniture fit only for Chatsworth
      or Belvoir. His little rooms are blocked up with bales of rich stuffs and
      heaps of gilded ornaments, which have cost more than he ean afford, yet
      which he has no opportunity and no room to display. Elegant and precious
      in themselves, they are here utterly out of place; and their possessor
      finds that, at a ruinous expense, he has bought nothing but inconvenience
      and ridicule. Who has not seen men to whom ancient learning is an absolute
      curse, who have laboured only to accumulate what they cannot enjoy? They
      come forth into the world, expecting to find only a larger university.
      They find that they are surrounded by people who have not the least
      respect for the skill with which they detect etymologies, and twist
      corrupt Epodes into something like meaning. Classical knowledge is indeed
      valued by all intelligent <span class="pagenum">353</span><a name="link353"
       id="link353"></a>men; but not such classical knowledge as theirs. To be
      prized by the public, it must be refined from its grosser particles,
      burnished into splendour, formed into graceful ornaments, or into current
      coin. Learning in the ore, learning with all the dross around it, is
      nothing to the common spectator. He prefers the cheapest tinsel; and
      leaves the rare and valuable clod, to the few who have the skill to detect
      its qualities, and the curiosity to prize them.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man, we allow, can be said to have received a complete and liberal
      education, unless he have acquired a knowledge of the ancient languages.
      But not one gentleman in fifty can possibly receive what we should call a
      complete and liberal education. That term includes not only the ancient
      languages, but those of France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It includes
      mathematics, the experimental sciences, and moral philosophy. An intimate
      acquaintance both with the profound and polite parts of English literature
      is indispensable. Few of those who are intended for professional or
      commercial life can find time for all these studies. It necessarily
      follows, that some portion of them must be given up: And the question is,
      what portion? We say, provide for the mind as you provide for the body,&mdash;first
      necessaries,&mdash;then conveniences,&mdash;lastly luxuries. Under which
      of those heads do the Greek and Latin languages come? Surely under the
      last. Of all the pursuits which we have mentioned, they require the
      greatest sacrifice of time. He who can afford time for them, and for the
      others also, is perfectly right in acquiring them. He who cannot, will, if
      he is wise, be content to go without them. If a man is able to continue
      his studies till his twenty-eighth or thirtieth year, by all means let him
      learn Latin and Greek. If he must terminate them at one-and-twenty, we
      should in general advise him to be satisfied with the modern languages. If
      he is forced to enter into active life at fifteen or sixteen, we should
      think it best that he should confine himself almost entirely to his native
      tongue, and thoroughly imbue his mind with the spirit of its best writers.
      But no! The artificial restraints and encouragements which our academic
      system has introduced have altogether <i>reversed</i> this natural and
      salutary order of things. We deny ourselves what is indispensable, that we
      may procure what is superfluous. We act like a day-labourer who should
      stint himself in bread, that he might now and then treat <span
      class="pagenum">354</span><a name="link354" id="link354"></a>himself with
      a pottle of January strawberries. Cicero tells us, in the Offices, a
      whimsical anecdote of Cato the Censor. Somebody asked him what was the
      best mode of employing capital, he said, To farm pood pasture land. What
      the next? To farm middling pasture land. What next? To farm bad pasture
      land. Now the notions which prevail in England respecting classical
      learning seem to us very much to resemble those which the old Roman
      entertained with regard to his favourite method of cultivation. Is a young
      man able to spare the time necessary for passing through the University?
      Make him a good classical scholar! But a second, instead of residing at
      the University, must go into business when he leaves school. Make him then
      a tolerable classical scholar! A third has still less time for snatching
      up knowledge, and is destined for active employment while still a boy.
      Make him a bad classical scholar! If he does not become a Flaminius, or a
      Buchanan, he may learn to write nonsense verses. If he does not get on to
      Horace, he may read the first book of Cæsar. If there is not time even for
      such a degree of improvement, he may at least be flogged through that
      immemorial vestibule of learning. &ldquo;Quis doeet? Who teacheth? Magister
      doeet. The master teacheth.&rdquo; Would to heaven that he taught something
      better worth knowing!
    </p>
    <p>
      All these evils are produced by the state of our Universities. Where they
      lead, those who prepare pupils for them, are forced to follow. Under a
      free system, the ancient languages would be less read, but quite as much
      enjoyed. We should not see so many lads who have a smattering of Latin and
      Greek, from which they derive no pleasure, and which, as soon as they are
      at liberty, they make all possible haste to forget. It must be owned,
      also, that there would be fewer young men really well acquainted with the
      ancient tongues. But there would be many more who had treasured up useful
      and agreeable information. Those who were compelled to bring their studies
      to an early close, would turn their attention to objects easily
      attainable. Those who enjoyed a longer space of literary leisure, would
      still exert themselves to acquire the classical languages. They would
      study them, not for any direct emolument which they would expect from the
      acquisition, but for their own intrinsic value. Their number would be
      smaller, no doubt, than that of present aspirants after <span
      class="pagenum">355</span><a name="link355" id="link355"></a>classical
      honours. But they would not, like most of those aspirants, leave Homer and
      Demosthenes to gather dust on the shelves, as soon as the temporary
      purpose had been served. There would be fewer good scholars of
      twenty-five; but we believe that there would be quite as many of fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto we have argued on the hypothesis most favourable to the
      Universities. We have supposed that the bounties which they offer to
      certain studies are fairly bestowed on those who excel. The fact however
      is, that they are in many cases appropriated to particular counties,
      parishes, or names. The effect of the former system is to encourage
      studies of secondary importance, at the expense of those which are
      entitled to preference. The effect of the latter is to encourage total
      idleness. It has been also asserted, that at some Colleges the
      distributors of fellowships and scholarships have allowed themselves to be
      influenced by party spirit, or personal animosity. On this point, however,
      we will not insist. We wish to expose the vices, not of individuals, but
      of the system. Indeed, in what we have hitherto written, we have generally
      had in our eye a College which exhibits that system in the most favourable
      light,&mdash;a College in which the evils which we have noticed are as
      much as possible alleviated by an enlightened and liberal administration,&mdash;a
      College not less distinguished by its opulence and splendour, than by the
      eminent talents of many of its members, by the freedom and impartiality of
      its elections, by the disposition which it has always shown to adopt
      improvements not inconsistent with its original constitution, and by the
      noble spirit with which it has supported the cause of civil and religious
      liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have hitherto reasoned as if all the students at our Universities
      learnt those things which the Universities profess to teach. But this is,
      notoriously, not the fact&mdash;and the cause is evident. All who wish for
      degrees must reside at College; but only those who expect to obtain prizes
      and fellowships apply themselves with vigour to classical and mathematical
      pursuits. The great majority have no inducement whatever to exert
      themselves. They have no hope of obtaining the premium; and no value for
      the knowledge without the premium. For the acquisition of other kinds of
      knowledge the Universities afford no peculiar facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence <span class="pagenum">356</span><a name="link356" id="link356"></a>proceeds
      the general idleness of collegians. Not one in ten we venture to say, ever
      makes any considerable proficiency in those pursuits to which every thing
      else is sacrificed. A very large proportion carry away from the University
      less of ancient literature than they brought thither. It is quite absurd
      to attribute such a state of tilings to the indolence and levity of youth.
      Nothing like it is seen elsewhere. There are idle lads, no doubt, among
      those who walk the hospitals, who sit at the desks of bankers, and serve
      at the counters of tradesmen. But what, after all, is the degree of <i>their</i>
      idleness, and what proportion do they bear to those who are active? Is it
      not the most common thing in the world, to see men who have passed their
      time at College in mere trifling, display the greatest energy as soon as
      they enter on the business of life, and become profound lawyers, skilful
      physicians, eminent writers? How can those things be explained, but by
      supposing that most of those who are compelled to reside at the
      Universities have no motive to learn what is taught there? Who ever
      employed a French master for four years without improving himself in
      French? The reason is plain. No man employs such a master, but from a wish
      to become acquainted with the language; and the same wish leads him to
      apply vigorously to it. Of those who go to our Universities, on the other
      hand, a large proportion are attracted, not by their desire to learn the
      things studied there, but by their wish to acquire certain privileges,
      which residence confers alike on the idle and on the diligent. Try the
      same experiment with the French language. Erect the teachers of it into a
      corporation. Give them the power of conferring degrees. Enact that no
      person who cannot produce a certificate, attesting that he has been for a
      certain number of years a student at this academy, shall be suffered to
      keep a shop; and we will venture to predict, that there will soon be
      thousands, who, after having wasted their money and their time in a formal
      attendance on lectures and examinations, will not understand the meaning
      of <i>Parlez-vous Français?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the general course of those who patronise an abuse to attribute to
      it every thing good which exists in spite of it. Thus, the defenders of
      our Universities commonly take it for granted, that we are indebted to
      them for all the talent which they have not been able to destroy. It is
      usual, when their merits <span class="pagenum">357</span><a name="link357"
       id="link357"></a>come under discussion, to enumerate very pompously all
      the great men whom they have produced; as if great men had not appeared
      under every system of education. Great men were trained in the schools of
      the Greek sophists and Arabian astrologers, of the Jesuits and the
      Jansenists. There were great men when nothing was taught but School
      Divinity and Canon Law; and there would still be great men if nothing were
      taught but the fooleries of Spurzheim and Swedenberg. A long list of
      eminent names is no more a proof of the excellence of onr Academic
      institutions, than the commercial prosperity of the country is a proof of
      the utility of restrictions in trade. No financial regulations, however
      absurd and pernicious, can prevent a people amongst whom property is
      secure, and the motive to accumulate consequently strong, from becoming
      rich. The energy with which every individual struggles to advance, more
      than counteracts the retarding force, and carries him forward, though at a
      slower rate, than if he were left at liberty. It is the same with
      restrictions which prevent the intellect from taking the direction which
      existing circumstances point out. They do harm. But they cannot wholly
      prevent other causes from producing good. In a country in which public
      opinion is powerful, in which talents properly directed are sure to raise
      their professor to distinction, ardent and aspiring minds will surmount
      all the obstacles which may oppose their career. It is amongst persons who
      are engaged in public and professional life that genius is most likely to
      be developed. Of these a large portion is necessarily sent to our English
      Universities. It would, therefore, be wonderful if the Universities could
      not boast of many considerable men. Yet, after all, we are not sure
      whether, if we were to pass in review the Houses of Parliament and the
      English and Scottish Bar, the result of the investigation would be so
      favourable as is commonly supposed to Oxford and Cambridge. And of this we
      are sure, that many persons who, since they have risen to eminence, are
      perpetually cited as proofs of the beneficial tendency of English
      education, were at College never mentioned but as idle, frivolous men,
      fond of desultory reading, and negligent of the studies of the place. It
      would be. indelicate to name the living; but we may venture to speak more
      particularly of the dead. It is truly curious to observe the use which is
      made in such discussions <span class="pagenum">358</span><a name="link358"
       id="link358"></a>as those, of names which we acknowledge to be glorious,
      but in which the Colleges have no reason to glory,&mdash;that of Bacon,
      who reprobated their fundamental constitution; of Dryden, who abjured his
      <i>Alma Muter</i>, and regretted that he had passed his youth under her
      cure; of Locke, who was censured and expelled; of Milton, whose person was
      outraged at one University, and whose works were committed to the flames
      at the other!
    </p>
    <p>
      That in particular cases an University education may have produced good
      effects, we do not dispute. But as to the great body of those who receive
      it, we have no hesitation in saying, that their minds permanently suffer
      from it. All the time which they can devote to the acquisition of
      speculative knowledge is wasted, and they have to enter into active life
      without it. They are compelled to plunge into the details of business, and
      are left to pick up general principles as they may. From all that we have
      seen and heard, we are inclined to suspect, in spite of all our patriotic
      prejudices, that the young men, we mean the very young men, of England,
      are not equal as a body to those of France, Germany, or Russia. They
      reason less justly, and the subjects with which they are chiefly
      conversant are less manly. As they grow older, they doubtless improve.
      Surrounded by a free people, enlightened by a free press, with the means
      of knowledge placed within their reach, and the rewards of exertion
      sparkling in their sight, it would indeed be strange if they did not in a
      great measure recover the superiority which they had lost. The finished
      men of England may, we allow, challenge a comparison with those of any
      nation. Yet our advantages are not so great that we can afford to
      sacrifice any of them. We do not proceed so rapidly, that we can prudently
      imitate the example of Lightfoot in the Nursery Tale, who never ran a race
      without tying his legs. The bad effects of our University system may be
      traced to the very last, in many eminent and respectable men. They have
      acquired great skill in business, they have laid up great stores of
      information. But something is still wanting. The superstructure is vast
      and splendid; but the foundations are unsound. It is evident that their
      knowledge is not systematised; that, however well they may argue on
      particular points, they have not that amplitude and intrepidity of
      intellect which it is the first object of education to produce. They hate
      abstract reasoning. <span class="pagenum">359</span><a name="link359"
       id="link359"></a>The very name of theory is terrible to them. They seem to
      think that the use of experience is not to lead men to the knowledge of
      general principles, but to prevent them from ever thinking about general
      principles at all. They may play at bo-peep with truth; but they never get
      a full view of it in all its proportions. The cause we believe is, that
      they have passed those years during which the mind frequently acquires the
      character which it ever after retains, in studies, which, when exclusively
      pursued, have no tendency to strengthen or expand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these radical defects of the old foundations the London University is
      free. It cannot cry up one study or cry down another. It has no means of
      bribing one man to learn what it is of no use to him to know, or of
      exacting a mock attendance from another who learns nothing at all. To be
      prosperous, it must be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would not be too sanguine. But there are signs of these times, and
      principles of human nature, to which we trust as firmly as ever any
      ancient astrologer trusted to the rules of his science. Judging from
      these, we will venture to cast the horoscope of the infant Institution. We
      predict, that the clamour by which it has been assailed will die away,&mdash;that
      it is destined to a long, a glorious, and a beneficent existence,&mdash;that,
      while the spirit of its system remains unchanged, the details will vary
      with the varying necessities and facilities of every age,&mdash;that it
      will be the model of many future establishments&mdash;that even those
      haughty foundations which now treat it with contempt, will in some degree
      feel its salutary influence,&mdash;and that the approbation of a great
      people, to whose wisdom, energy and virtue, its exertions will have
      largely contributed, will confer on it a dignity more imposing than any
      which it could derive from the most lucrative patronage, or the most
      splendid ceremonial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even those who think our hopes extravagant, must own that no positive harm
      has been even suggested as likely to result from this Institution. All the
      imputed sins of its founders are sins of omission. Whatever may be thought
      of them, it is surely better that something should be omitted, than that
      nothing should be done. The Universities it can injure in one way only&mdash;by
      surpassing them. This danger no sincere admirer of these bodies can
      apprehend. As for those who, believing that the project really tends to
      the good of <span class="pagenum">360</span><a name="link360" id="link360"></a>the
      country, continue to throw obloquy upon it&mdash;and that there are such
      men we believe&mdash;to them we have nothing to say. We have no hope of
      converting them; no wish to revile them. Let them quibble, declaim, sneer,
      calumniate. Their punishment is to be what they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      For us, our part has been deliberately chosen&mdash;and shall be manfully
      sustained. We entertain a firm conviction that the principles of liberty,
      as in government and trade, so also in education, are all-important to the
      happiness of mankind. To the triumph of those principles we look forward,
      not, we trust, with a fanatical confidence, but assuredly with a cheerful
      and steadfast hope. Their nature may be misunderstood. Their progress may
      be retarded. They may be maligned, derided, nay at times exploded, and
      apparently forgotten. But we do, in our souls, believe that they are
      strong with the strength, and quick with the vitality of truth; that when
      they fall, it is to rebound; that when they recede, it is to spring
      forward with greater elasticity; that when they seem to perish, there are

      a short time back that we entertained the slightest intention of
      criticising the speculations of Major Moody. We had supposed that they
      would of course pass in their infancy to that Limbo which is ordained for
      Laureate Odes, old Court Kalendars, and Sermons printed at the request of
      Congregations. That a Commissioner should write a dull Report, and that
      the Government should give him a place for it, are events by no means so
      rare as to call for notice. Of late, however, we have with great surprise
      discovered, that the books of the Major have been added to the political
      canon of Downing-Street, and that it has become quite a fashion among
      statesmen who are still in their novitiate, to talk about physical causes
      and the philosophy of labour. As the doctrines which, from some
      inexplicable cause, have acquired so much popularity, appear to us both
      false and pernicious, we shall attempt, with as much brevity as possible,
      to expose their absurdity.

      In order, therefore, that our remarks on the Report of Major Moody may he
      clearly understood, we shall give a short account of the circumstances
      under which it appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Act which abolished the trade in slaves, the King was empowered to
      make regulations for the employment and support of Negroes, who, under the
      provisions of that Act, or in the course of hostilities with foreign
      States, might be rescued from their kidnappers. Some of these liberated
      Africans were, in consequence, admitted into the army and the navy. Others
      were bound apprentices in the colonies: and of these last many were
      settled at Tortola.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1821, the House of Commons presented an address to the King,
      requesting that commissioners might be sent to ascertain the condition of
      these people, and to report it to the Government. Major Moody was selected
      for this purpose by the Colonial Office. Mr. Dougan, a gentleman to whose
      talents and integrity the Major bears the highest testimony, was joined
      with him in the commission. But Mr. Dougan, whatever his good qualities
      may have been, was under the influence of some unhappy prejudices, from
      which his colleague appears to have been wholly free, he had been led to
      adopt the extravagant notion that the Africans were his fellow-creatures;
      and this delusion betrayed him into errors which Major Moody, to his
      eternal honour, endeavours to palliate, but which a less candid and
      amiable censor would have stigmatized with the severest reprehension. Our
      readers will be shocked to hear that an English gentleman actually desired
      a black apprentice, during a long examination, to take a seat! and they
      will be touched by the delicacy and generosity of the Major, who mentions
      this disgrace! ill occurrence &ldquo;only,&rdquo; as he says, &ldquo;to show the bias on the
      mind of his colleague when one of the African race was concerned with a
      white person.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      At length some female Africans in the service of a person named Maclean,
      were brought before the Commissioners. By their statement, and by the
      confession of the master himself, it appeared that they had been cruelly
      treated. Maclean, too, it appeared, had no legal right to them: for they
      had been originally apprenticed to another person, and the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) First Part of Major Moody&rsquo;s Report, page 103.
</pre>
    <p>
      indentures <span class="pagenum">363</span><a name="link363" id="link363"></a>had
      never been transferred. Mr. Dougan thought it desirable to take advantage
      of this circumstance, and at once to place them in a more comfortable
      situation; and he prevailed on his colleague to concur with him in
      recommending the case to the particular consideration of the collector. In
      the mean time, however, Maclean wrote to the Commissioners, requesting
      them to revise their proceedings, and most impudently telling them, at the
      same time, <i>that he had whipped the apprentices with tamarind switches
      for daring to bear evidence against him!</i> Mr. Dougan seems to have
      imagined that such conduct was grossly insulting to the Commissioners, and
      to the government which employed them. He probably thought, too, that to
      re-examine persons who had been flogged for what they had stated on a
      former examination, would be to violate every principle of equity and
      reason. On this point, it Appears that Major Moody was of a different
      opinion; and conceived that truth was likely enough to be obtained from a
      witness who had just learned that if his evidence be disagreeable to the
      accused party, he will undergo severe chastisement. A rupture took place.
      The apprentices, we should perhaps say the slaves, remained with Maclean;
      and Mr. Dougan returned to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we really cannot continue to speak ironically on a subject so serious.
      We do earnestly and gravely assure Major Moody, that we think his conduct,
      on this occasion, most unjust and unreasonable. Lord Bathurst seems to
      have entertained the same opinion: For in consequence of orders sent out
      from England, the wretched women were taken from Maclean and apprenticed
      to another master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dougan now returned to the West Indies; and the disputes between him
      and his colleague recommenced. At length both were recalled. Mr. Dougan
      drew up a report of the proceedings under the commission. The Major
      refused to concur in it, and presented a separate statement in answer to
      it. Mr. Dougan, while labouring under a fatal malady, prepared a reply.
      This document has, since his death, been transmitted to the Colonial
      Office, and will, of course, be published with all expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dougan thought it sufficient to perform the duty with which he was
      charged. His report is therefore, what it professes to be, an account of
      the condition of the liberated Africans. <span class="pagenum">364</span><a
      name="link364" id="link364"></a>But the genius of the Major was not to be
      confined within limits so narrow. He had command, without stint, of the
      public paper and the publie type. He conceived that the opportunity was
      not to be lost&mdash;that now or never was the time to be a philosopher
      like his neighbours, and to have a system of his own, which might be
      called after his name. The history of the liberated Africans forms,
      therefore, a mere episode in his plan. His report is, in substance, a
      defence of West Indian slavery, on certain new principles, which
      constitute what he is pleased to call the Philosophy of Labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      His theory has met with a very flattering reception from those who are
      favourably inclined to the Colonial system, because they dread innovation,
      because they hate the saints, or because they have mortgages on West
      Indian plantations. Unable themselves to defend their opinion, but
      obstinately determined not to renounce it, they are pleased with a writer
      who abounds in phrases which sound as if they meant something, and which,
      in the chat of a drawing-room, or in the leading article of a newspaper,
      supply the place of a reason very creditably.
    </p>
    <p>
      We come to the consideration of the Report with no such bias upon our
      minds, and we have, therefore, formed a very different estimate of it. We
      think that it is, in matter and manner, the worst state-paper that we ever
      saw. The style is the jargon of a tenth-rate novelist, engrafted on that
      of a tenth-rate pamphleteer. It abounds with that vague diction which the
      political winters of France have invented, and by which they often
      contrive to keep up appearances in spite of the most abject mental
      poverty. At certain distances, and in certain lights, this paltry and
      pinchbeck logic serves its purpose respectably; and to this,
      unquestionably, the Major owes the greater part of his reputation. The
      highest compliment which we can, with any sincerity, pay to him, is to
      say, that he has some faults in common with Montesquieu&mdash;a writer
      whom he evidently regards with great admiration. He calls one of the
      silliest remarks of the lively president profound&mdash;an epithet which
      would have amazed us if we had not recollected that the terms in which we
      describe magnitudes, whether material or intellectual, are only relative,&mdash;that
      the Grildrig of Brobdignag may be the Quinbus Flestrin of Lilliput. The
      theories of Montesquieu are gone where the <span class="pagenum">365</span><a
      name="link365" id="link365"></a>theories of the Major will soon go. But
      though Montesquieu could not keep his doctrines alive, he understood how
      to embalm them. Their mummies are beyond all price. The mouldering remains
      are valued, for the sake of the intricate folds in which they are swathed
      up, the sweet and pungent spices with which they are seasoned, and the
      gilded hieroglyphics with which they are emblazoned. The Major has no such
      skill. Abundance of italics, and occasional flowers of speech from the
      Emmelines and Adelines of the Minerva Press, are the only ornaments which
      set off his speculations. If our object were to render him ridiculous, we
      could easily fill our pages with solecisms, with affected phrases, with
      sentences of which the obscurity would leave the most sagacious
      interpreter at a fault. But this is not our intention. We shall direct our
      attacks against the great principles of his theory. To find these out,
      indeed, is no easy task. For the work has neither beginning nor end. The
      author, instead of taking the trouble to state his propositions, and class
      his arguments for himself, has left the whole of that task to his
      opponents, and has made it as difficult as possible by the most elaborate
      artifice of disorder. We shall do our best, however, to perform it
      faithfully, and to separate the most important passages from much curious
      matter concerning the feudal system&mdash;the chisel of Phidias&mdash;the
      marriage in Cana of Galilee&mdash;the difference between Theory and
      Practice&mdash;the choice of Hercules&mdash;the peace and happiness of
      rural life&mdash;the rape of the Sabines&mdash;the Supreme Being&mdash;and
      Major Moody himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first great principle, then, which the Major professes to have
      discovered is this, that there exists between the White and Black races an
      instinctive and unconquerable aversion, which must forever frustrate all
      hopes of seeing them unite in one society on equal terms. We shall
      consider in succession the facts from which he draws this bold conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the constitution of Hayti, it seems, no white man of any nation can be
      a master or proprietor in that island. From this circumstance the Major
      deduces the following inferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>It seems as if each party, when in power, acts as if it was mutually
      thought the two races could not exist together, in the same community,
      with equal political powers, from the operation of some powerful causes,
      <span class="pagenum">366</span><a name="link366" id="link366"></a>which
      do not appear to have been felt in England in former ages, when lier
      inhabitants were composed of freemen and slaves, or when national
      distinctions among people living in the same country formed a political
      barrier between Britons and Romans, or Saxons and Normans.&rdquo;</i>(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover a young Haytian, named Moyse, about thirty years ago, complained
      of the attention which Toussaint Louvertu re paid to the interests of the
      Europeans, and declared that he should never like the whites till they
      should restore to him the eye which he had lost in battle, with them! This
      last important anecdote, the Major prints in italics, as quite decisive.
      (2) The poor Haytian must have been best acquainted with the origin of his
      own feelings; and, as he ascribed them to a cause which might well account
      for them, it is difficult to divine why any other should be assigned. The
      liberality of Toussaint, also, is at least as strong an argument against
      the hypothesis of Major Moody, as the animosity of Moyse can be in its
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the law which declares white men incapable of becoming proprietors in
      Hayti, nothing can be inferred. Such prohibitions are exceedingly foolish;
      but they have existed, as every person knows who knows any thing of
      history, in cases where no natural antipathy can be supposed to have
      produced them. We need not refer to the measures which the Kings of Spain
      adopted against their Moorish subjects&mdash;to that tyranny of nation
      over nation which has, in every age, been the curse of Asia&mdash;or to
      the jealous policy which excludes strangers, of all races, from the
      interior of China and Japan. Our own country will furnish an example
      strictly in point. By the common law of England, no alien whatever can
      hold land, even as a tenant. The natives of Scotland remained under this
      incapacity, till the two divisions of the island were united under James
      the First: and even then, the national prejudice was strong against the
      removal of the disability. The House of Commons was decidedly averse to
      it. The Court, in consequence, had recourse to a measure grossly
      unconstitutional. The Judges were persuaded to <i>declare</i> that to be
      law which the Parliament could not be persuaded to <i>make</i> law; and
      even thus it was found impossible to remove the restriction from Scotchmen
      born before the Union of the Crowns.

    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">367</span><a name="link367" id="link367"></a>Major
      ought to be well acquainted with these proceedings. For Lord Bacon, of
      whom he professes himself a disciple, appeared as counsel for the
      post-nati. It is amusing to consider what the feelings of that illustrious
      man would have been, if some half-taught smatterer of his philosophy had
      risen to oppose him with such arguments as these. &ldquo;The English can never
      amalgamate with any foreign nation. The existence and the popularity of
      such a law as this sufficiently prove that some powerful cause operates
      upon our countrymen, which does not act elsewhere. Our ancestors always
      felt that, although in other countries foreigners may be permitted and
      even encouraged by the natives to settle among them, no such mixture could
      take place here. I have been credibly informed also, that a Scotchman
      whose eye was struck out in a fray forty years back, swore that he never
      could bear the sight of a Southern after.&rdquo; With what a look would Sir
      Francis have risen to annihilate such an argument! What mirth would have
      shone in his eyes! What unsavoury similitudes would have risen to his
      lips! With what confusion would the dabbler in experimental science have
      shrunk from a conflict with that all-embracing and all-penetrating mind,
      which fancy had elevated but not inebriated, which professional study had
      rendered subtle, but could not render narrow. As the Major seems very
      willing to be an experimental philosopher, if he knew how to set about it,
      we will give him one general rule, of which he seems never to have heard.
      It is this. When the phenomena can be explained by circumstances which, on
      grounds distinct from those phenomena, we know to exist, we must not
      resort to hypothetical solutions. We are not entitled to attribute the
      hatred which the Haytian Blacks may have felt towards the Whites to any
      latent physical cause, till we have shown that the ordinary principles of
      human nature will not explain it. Is it not natural, then, that men should
      hate those by whom they have been held in slavery, and to whom they have
      subsequently been opposed in a war of peculiar ferocity? Is it not also
      perfectly agreeable to that law of association, from which so large a
      portion of our pains and pleasures is derived, that what we have long
      regarded as a distinguishing badge of those whom we hate should itself
      become hateful to us? If these questions be answered in the affirmative,
      the aversion <span class="pagenum">368</span><a name="link368" id="link368"></a>which
      the Haytian Negroes are said to entertain towards the Whites is at once
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same remark applies to all that the Major has said respecting the
      state of public feeling in North America. The facts of the case he has
      stated quite correctly. It is true that, even in those States of the Union
      which have abolished slavery, the free Blacks are still regarded with
      disgust and contempt. The most benevolent inhabitants of New England and
      New York, conceive that liberty itself will scarcely be a blessing to the
      African, unless measures be taken for removing him to some country where
      he may not be reminded of his inferiority by daily insults and privations.
      Hence Major Moody thought himself, as he tells us,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>justified in
      the inference, that some powerful causes must be in action, and that those
      of a physical nature had not been overcome by mere legal exactments</i>.&rdquo;
       (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be doubted that some powerful cause has been in action. But that
      it is a physical cause, is not quite so clear. The old laws have no doubt
      produced a state of public feeling, which their repeal cannot at once
      correct. In all the States the Negro colour <i>has been</i> the livery of
      servitude. In some it still <i>is</i> so. The connexion between the
      different commonwealths of the confederation is so close, that the state
      of feeling in one place must be influenced by the state of the laws in
      another. This consideration is surely sufficient to explain all the
      circumstances to which the Major refers. It is for him to show, that an
      aversion for which <i>slavery</i> alone will sufficiently account is
      really the effect of <i>blackness</i>. He would, we believe, find it as
      easy to prove that there is something <i>naturally</i> and universally
      loathsome in the cut and colour of a prison uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the complexion of the free African renders his condition more
      unfortunate, we acknowledge. But why does it produce this effect? Not,
      surely, because <i>it is</i> the degrading circumstance, but because it is
      clear, instantaneous, and irrefragable <i>evidence</i> of the degrading
      circumstance. It is the only brand which cannot be counterfeited, and
      which cannot be effaced. It is borne by slaves and their descendants; and
      it is borne by no others. Let the Major prove, that, in any society where
      personal bondage has never existed, the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Second Part of Major Moody&rsquo;s Report, p. 27.
</pre>
    <p>
      whites <span class="pagenum">369</span><a name="link369" id="link369"></a>and
      blacks have felt this mutual dislike. Till he can show this, he does
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it seems, an anonymous writer in South America, some years ago,
      declared, that the blacks never could amalgamate with the whites. (1) That
      a man who had passed his life among negro <i>slaves</i> should transfer to
      their colour the feelings of contempt with which he regarded their
      condition, and the mean vices to which that condition necessarily gave
      birth, was perfectly natural. That he should suppose a feeling, of which
      he could not remember the origin, to be instinctive, was also natural. The
      most profound thinkers have fallen into similar errors. But that a man in
      England should believe all this, only because a man at Bogota chose to
      write it, argues a strange degree of credulity. Such vague authority is
      not sufficient to establish a fact. To quote it in support of a general
      proposition, is an insult to common sense. The expressions of this
      Columbian prove only, what the refusal of the Major to let a negro sit in
      his presence proves as satisfactorily, that there are very weak and very
      prejudiced people in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feelings exactly similar to those which are unhappily so common among the
      whites of the United States, have often existed in cases where it is
      impossible to attribute them to physical causes. From a time beyond the
      researches of historians, an impassable gulf has separated the Brahmin
      from the Paria. The Jews were long regarded by the Spaniards and
      Portuguese with as much contempt and hatred as the white North American
      feels for the man of colour. The cases, indeed, are strikingly similar.
      The national features and rites of the Hebrews, like the black skin and
      woolly hair of the Africans, visibly distinguished them from the rest of
      the community. Every individual of the race bore about him the badges of
      the synagogue. Baptism itself could not wash away the distinction.
      Conversion might save him from the flames; but the stigma was indelible&mdash;he
      bore it to the grave&mdash;he bequeathed it to his children&mdash;his
      descendants, as long as their genealogy could be traced, were objects of
      scorn to the poorest Castilian peasant, who gloried in the name of an old
      Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we will not multiply examples in a case so plain. We hasten to another
      argument, on which Major Moody
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Second Part of Major Moody&rsquo;s Report, p. 23. 24
</pre>
    <p>
      dwells <span class="pagenum">370</span><a name="link370" id="link370"></a>with
      peculiar complacency. At this, indeed, we do not much wonder. It is
      entirely his own. He is the first writer who ever used it, and we venture
      to prophesy that he will be the last. We speak of his remarks on the
      influence of the sexual passion. We will give his own words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In such committees as I have referred to, an observer will not fail to
      discover the want of a certain class of sympathies, which are daily seen
      in action when men of the same race live together, even in republics, like

      consisted of men of different nations and habits, but yet resembling each
      other in external form, colour, features, &amp;c. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I allude to the extraordinary rarity of virtuous unions having taken
      place between the males and females of the pure Negroes and the pure
      Whites in America. I certainly have heard of such unions as in certain
      classes of society are seen in London; but in America, they were
      considered rather as very extraordinary occurrences, particularly if the
      male should be a pure negro, and the female a pure white. On the other
      hand, when the female is an African, lust, aided by fear or avarice, has
      often led to an illicit union between the sexes....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the New World of America, virtuous unions between the extreme colours
      of black and white are always considered something in violation of the
      ordinary sympathies which spring from a pure affection, and therefore
      derogatory to the feelings of caste; for even the free coloured females, I
      understand, would have a reluctance, if advanced in civilization, to form
      a virtuous union with a pure negro....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the intelligent free negroes of the United States, with whom I
      often conversed, for the express purpose of personal observation, felt the
      ban under which they were put, by the influence of prejudice, as they
      considered it, after the laws of the country had declared them free, and
      equal to any other citizen of the State; and, in the confidence inspired
      by my inquiries about their situation, I was often asked if, in England,
      white women did not marry black men? And, with apparent simplicity, it was
      inquired why the American white women were so prejudiced against black
      men?...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who merely refer the degraded state of the free Africans or blacks
      to their having been formerly slaves, and leave out of their consideration
      the consequences arising from physical differences in form, colour,
      feature, and smell, influencing those general ideas of beauty, creating
      that passion of love that most commonly leads to a virtuous union of the
      sexes of different nations, must be considered as having taken a very
      narrow view of the question, from the prevalent custom of merely referring
      to moral causes alone, and omitting all references to those of a physical
      nature, though still more powerful in their effect.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      This extraordinary argument is concluded by a touching representation of
      the refinement which modesty gives to pleasure, and of the happiness of
      being cherished and beloved, which, we hope, will edify the young
      gentlemen of the

      Colonial <span class="pagenum">371</span><a name="link371" id="link371"></a>Office,
      but which has, we think, little to do with the question. This, therefore,
      we omit, as well as the pious appeal to the God of Truth, which follows
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it possible that the Major does not perceive how directly all his
      statement leads towards a conclusion, diametrically opposite to that at
      which, by some inconceivable process, he has managed to arrive? We will
      give him an answer. But we really hope that he is the only one of our
      readers who will need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passion of the sexes is a natural appetite. Marriage is a civil and
      religious institution. Where, therefore, between two classes of people,
      the passion exists, but marriage is not practised, it is evident that
      nature impels them to unite, and that acquired feelings only keep them
      asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Major Moody just reverses this mode of reasoning. Because the Whites
      form with the Blacks those illicit unions, to which the motive is
      physical, but do not form those legitimate unions to which the motive is
      moral, he actually infers that the cause which separates the races is not
      moral, but physical! In the same manner, we presume, he would maintain,
      that a man who dines heartily without saying grace, is deficient, not in
      devotion, but in appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story which he tells respecting the free blacks, with whom he
      conversed in the United States, is alone sufficient to show the absurdity
      of his hypothesis. From his own account, it is plain that these blacks had
      no antipathy to white women. The repugnance was all on one side. And on
      which side? On that of the privileged class, of those whose superiority
      was till lately recognised by law, and is still established by custom. Is
      this a phenomenon so extraordinary that we must have recourse to a new
      instinct to account for it? Or may it not be explained into the same
      causes which in England prevent a lady from marrying a tinker, though the
      tinker would gladly marry the lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last century, the dissipated nobles of France lavished their wealth
      with the wildest profusion on actresses and opera girls. The favour of a
      distinguished heroine of this class, was thought to be cheaply purchased
      at the price of jewels, gilded coaches, palaces blazing with mirrors, or
      even of some drops of aristocratic blood. Yet the poorest gentleman in the
      kingdom would not have married Clairon. This, Major Moody would say,
      proves that men who wear swords, feather, <span class="pagenum">372</span><a
      name="link372" id="link372"></a>and red-heeled shoes, entertain a natural
      aversion to women who recite verses out of Andromaque and Tartuffe. <i>We</i>
      think that we could hit on a different explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happed, indeed, rather unluckily, that, of the phenomena which the
      Major recounts, there is none which cannot be satisfactorily explained
      into moral cause, and none which can possibly be explained into physical
      causes. White women, says he, much more rarely form licentious connections
      with black men, than white men with black women. And this is a proof that
      the aversion of the two races is natural. Why, if it were natural, does it
      not influence both sexes alike? The principles to which these facts must
      be referred, are principles which we see in daily operation among
      ourselves. Men of the highest rank in our country, are frequently engaged
      in low amours. The wife or daughter of an English gentleman very seldom
      forgets herself so far. But who ever thought of attributing this to
      physical causes?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major, however, is resolved not to leave himself unrefuted in any
      point. &ldquo;Even the free coloured females,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;would have a
      reluctance, if advanced in civilization, to form a virtuous union with a
      pure negro.&rdquo; He cannot pretend to believe that any physical cause operates
      here: and, indeed, distinctly attributes the reluctance of the coloured
      female to her advancement in civilization. That is to say, he distinctly
      acknowledges that certain acquired habits, and certain advantages of rank
      and education, are alone sufficient to produce those effects which,
      according to his own theory laid down in the same page, can only result
      from natural organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major tells us, the colour, the features, and the other peculiarities
      of the black race, excite the disgust of Europeans. Here his testimony is
      at variance with that of almost all the writers on the subject with whom
      we are acquainted. Travellers and historians innumerable, have asserted,
      that white men in the torrid zone, generally prefer black females to those
      of their own country, Raynal, if we remember rightly, gives a very
      rational explanation of the circumstance. It is needless, however, to
      attack the Major with authorities from other writers. He may easily be
      refuted out of his own mouth. How can the physical peculiarities of <span
      class="pagenum">373</span><a name="link373" id="link373"></a>the African
      race be more offensive in the wife than in the concubine? It is quite
      needless to inquire into the origin of the different opinions which
      people, in different situations, form on the subject of beauty. It is
      quite enough for us at present to discover, that if a man does not think a
      woman too ugly to make her his mistress, it cannot surely be on account of
      her ugliness that he does not make her his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      In England white women not unfrequently marry black men. We have ourselves
      known several such instances. Yet if the external appearance of the negro
      were such as naturally to inspire aversion, that feeling would be more
      strongly excited in a country of which the inhabitants are not
      familiarized by use to the revolting spectacle. This consideration alone
      would satisfy us that the real cause of the horror with which the Whites
      in some other countries shrink from the thought of marriage with an
      African is to be found, not in physical, but in political and moral
      circumstances. We entertain little doubt, that when the laws which create
      a distinction between the races shall be completely abolished, a very few
      generations will mitigate the prejudices which those laws have created,
      and which they still maintain. At that time, the black girl, who, as a
      slave, would have attracted a white lover, will, when her father has given
      her a good education, and can leave her a hundred thousand dollars, find
      no difficulty in procuring a white husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have perhaps dwelt too long on the feeble and inconsistent arguments
      which the Major has urged in support of his hypothesis. But we were
      desirous, before we entered on that part of his work which relates to
      questions of more difficulty, to furnish our readers with a specimen of
      his logical powers. They will perhaps be inclined to suspect, that a man
      who reasons thus on one subject, is not very likely to reason justly on
      any.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now come to the second great principle which Major Moody conceives
      himself to have established. It may be stated thus. The inhabitants of
      countries lying within the torrid zone ean be induced to engage in steady
      agricultural labour only by necessity. The barrenness of the soil, or the
      density of the population, may create that necessity. In Hindostan, for
      example, the peasant must work or starve. But where a few inhabitants are
      thinly scattered over the <span class="pagenum">374</span><a name="link374"
       id="link374"></a>country, they will be able to procure a subsistence with
      very little exertion. With a subsistence they will be content. The heat
      renders agricultural labour so painful that those who are their own
      masters will prefer the enjoyment of repose to any of the comforts which
      they might be able to procure by regular industry. For this evil the only
      remedy is coercion, or, in other words, slavery. Such are the elements of
      the new philosophy of labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be doubted whether these doctrines, if admitted, would amount to a
      vindication of slavery. It does not appear to us quite certain that we are
      justified in compelling our fellow-creatures to engage in a particular
      employment, merely because that employment gives them exquisite pain. If a
      large portion of the human race be really placed in regions where rest and
      shade are the most delightful luxuries which they can enjoy, a benevolent
      man may perhaps be of opinion that they ought to be suffered to doze in
      their huts, except when necessity may drive them to employ an occasional
      hour in angling, gathering berries, or scattering a little rice in the
      marshes. We are entitled to demand that this point shall be saved to us;
      but we do not foresee that we shall need it. We assert, and will prove,
      that Major Moody has not established his theory; that he has not even
      raised a presumption in its favour; and that the tacts on which he relies
      are either such as have no relation to the question, or such as occur
      daily in every climate of the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will begin with the case with which Major Moody would have done well
      both to begin and end&mdash;the case of the liberated Africans who were
      placed in Tortola. We must premise, that no experiment was ever made under
      circumstances less favourable. The Negroes, when received from the holds
      of the slave ships, were in a state of extreme weakness and disease. Of
      six hundred and seventeen Blacks who were taken from the Venus and the
      Manuella, two hundred and twenty-two died before they could be settled as
      apprentices. (1) The constitutions of many who survived were completely
      broken. By the masters to whom they were apprenticed, they were frequently
      treated with inhumanity. The laws and institutions of Tortola, framed for
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Mr. Dougan&rsquo;s Report, p. 7.
</pre>
    <p>
      a <span class="pagenum">375</span><a name="link375" id="link375"></a>society
      made up of masters and slaves, were, as the Major himself states, by no
      means fitted for the regulation of such a class of persons as the
      apprenticed Africans. The poorer freemen of every colour felt an enmity
      towards people who were about to intrude themselves into those trades of
      which they possessed a monopoly. The planters were not inclined to look
      with favour on the first fruits of the abolition. Apprentices are, in
      every part of the world, noted for idleness. The degree of that idleness
      is in general proportioned to the length of the term for which they are
      bound to an unrequited service. The man who expects soon to be his own
      master, may exert himself to acquire skill in the business by which he is
      to subsist. He, on the other hand, who expects to waste half of his life
      in labour without remuneration, will generally do as little as he possibly
      can. The liberated Africans were most injudiciously apprenticed for
      fourteen years, and some even for a longer time. They had neither the
      motive of the freeman, nor that of the slave. They could not legally
      demand wages. They could not legally be subjected to the driver. Under
      these disadvantages was the trial made. And what was the result?
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Moody examined into the conduct of sixty-one apprenticed negroes who
      had been rescued from the Manuella. The masters and mistresses were
      carefully interrogated. It appears from the schedules signed by the Major
      himself, that good characters were given to forty, and only appeared to be
      idle and disorderly. With respect to twelve, no decisive information was
      obtained. A similar inquiry took place respecting fifty-five apprentices
      who had formed a part of the cargo of the Venus. Good accounts were
      received of forty. Only six were described as idle and disorderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among sixty-five negroes who had been taken from the Candelario, there was
      not a single instance of grossly bad conduct. Fifty-seven received fair
      characters for honesty and industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, of one hundred and ten negroes who had been on board of the
      Atrevido, only four are characterized as decidedly worthless. Nine may be
      considered as doubtful. A favourable report is given of the remaining
      ninety-seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      These facts, as we have said, we find in the papers signed by the Major
      himself. He has not, it is true, thought it necessary <span class="pagenum">376</span><a
      name="link376" id="link376"></a>to give us the result of his inquiries in
      the Report so compendiously as we now exhibit it. He dwells at great
      length on particular cases which prove nothing. He fills page after page
      with the nonsense of planters who had no apprentices, who evidently knew
      nothing about the apprentices, and who, in general terms, proving nothing
      but their own malevolence, characterized the whole race as idle,
      disorderly, quarrelsome, drunken, greedy. But, from the beginning to the
      end of the Report, he has not been able to spare three lines for the
      simple fact, that four fifths of these vilified people receive excellent
      characters from their actual employers, from those who must have been best
      acquainted with their disposition, and who would have lost most by their
      idleness. Whoever wishes to know how Daniel Quabott broke his wife&rsquo;s nose&mdash;how
      Penelope glum whipped a slave who had the yaws, how the Major, seventeen
      years ago, went without his supper in Guiana&mdash;how the arts and
      sciences proceeded northward from Carthage till they were stopped by the
      frozen zone, may find in the Report all this interesting information, and
      much more of the same kind. But those who wish to know that which Major
      Moody was commissioned to ascertain, and which it was his peculiar duty to
      state, must turn over three hundred folio pages of schedules. The Report
      does not, as far as we have been able to discover, give the most distant
      hint of the discoveries which they will make there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no idea of charging the Major with intentional unfairness. But his
      prejudices really seem to have blinded him as to the effect of the
      evidence which he had himself collected. He hints that his colleague had
      privately prepared the apprentices for the examination. Of the justice of
      this charge we shall be better able to judge when the answer of Mr. Dougan
      shall make its appearance. But be it well founded or not, it cannot affect
      <i>our</i> argument. The Major does not pretend to insinuate, that any
      arts were practised with <i>the masters</i>, and it is on the testimony of
      the masters alone that we are willing to rest onr case. Indeed, the
      evidence which was collected by the Major in the absence of his colleague,
      and which we must therefore suppose to be perfectly pure, tends to the
      same effect, and would alone be sufficient to show, that the apprentices
      have, as a body, conducted themselves in a manner which, under any
      circumstances, would have been most satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <span class="pagenum">377</span><a name="link377" id="link377"></a>is
      perfectly true, that a knot of slave-owners, forming the legislature of
      Tortola, petitioned the Government to remove these apprentices from the
      island. From internal evidence, from the peculiar cant in which the
      petition abounds, and from the sprinkling of bad grammar which adorns it,
      we are half inclined to suspect that it is the Major&rsquo;s own handywork. At
      all events, it is curious to see how he reasons on it. It is curious to
      see how the Major reasons on this fact:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Doubtless, the legislature of Tortola may be mistaken in their
      opinions; but the mere fact of their agreeing to sign such a petition,
      shows they really did think, that the labour of the African apprentices,
      when free, would not be useful to them or the colonists generally. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this fact alone, my Lord, is calculated to excite important
      reflections, as to the character of the free Africans, for industry in
      West Indian agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it probable, that mere prejudice against the colour of a man&rsquo;s skin
      could ever induce anybody of people, like the Tortola petitioners, to make
      a request so apparently absurd, as that of removing from their colony a
      numerous body of Africans, consisting of able bodied men and women, If
      they were as willing as they were capable of working, and increasing the
      value of the land now given to pasturage, for want of cultivators to be
      employed therein.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      We earnestly request our readers to observe the consistency of Major
      Moody. When his object is to prove, that whites and blacks cannot
      amalgamate on equal terms, in one political society, he exaggerates every
      circumstance which tends to keep them asunder. The physical differences
      between the races, he tells us, practically defeat benevolent laws. No Act
      of Parliament, no order in Council, can surmount the difficulty. (2) Where
      these differences exist, the principles of republican equality are
      forgotten by the strongest republican. Marriage becomes an unnatural
      prostitution. The Haytian refuses to admit the white to possess property
      within the sphere of negro domination. The most humane and enlightened
      citizen of the United States, can discover no means of benefiting the free
      African, but by sending him to a distance from men of European blood. &ldquo;I
      should ill-perform my duty,&rdquo; says the Major, &ldquo;if I suppressed all mention
      of a physical cause like this, which in practice is found to have an
      effect so powerful, however the philanthropist
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">378</span><a name="link378" id="link378"></a>or the
      philosopher may regret it, and however it may be beyond their power to
      remove it by legislative means.&rdquo; (1) But, when it is desirable to prove
      the idleness of the free African, this omnipotent physical cause, this
      instinct against which the best and wisest men struggle in vain, which
      counteracts the attraction of sex, and defies the authority of law, sinks
      into a &ldquo;mere prejudice against the colour of a man&rsquo;s skin,&rdquo; an idle fancy,
      which never could induce any body of people to remove able bodied men and
      women from their country, if those men and women were willing to work. Are
      all the free negroes of North America infirm, or are they all unwilling to
      work? They live in a temperate climate, and to them the Major&rsquo;s theory
      does not apply. Yet the whites are subscribing to transport them to
      another country. Why should we suppose the planters of Tortola to be
      superior to feelings which some of the most respectable men in the world
      are disposed to gratify, by sending thousands of people, at a great
      expense, from a country greatly understocked with hands?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that the apprenticed Africans were not employed in the
      cultivation of the soil. The cause is evident. They could not legally be
      so employed. The Older in Council under the authority of which they were
      put out to service, provided that no woman should be employed in tillage.
      The blank form of indenture sent out by the government contained a similar
      restriction with regard to the males.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are, however, inclined to believe with the Major, that these people, if
      they had been left to take their own course, would not have employed
      themselves in agriculture. Those who have become masters of their time,
      rarely do so employ themselves. We will go further. We allow that very few
      of the free blacks in our West Indian Islands, will undergo the drudgery
      of cultivating the ground. Major Moody seems to think that, when this is
      grunted, all his principles follow of course. But we can by no means agree
      with him. In order to prove that the natives of tropical countries
      entertain a peculiar aversion to agricultural labour, it is by no means
      sufficient to show that certain freemen, living in the torrid zone, do not
      choose to engage in agricultural labour. It is, we humbly conceive,
      necessary also to show, that the wages of agricultural labour are, at the
      place and time in
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Second Part of Major Moody&rsquo;s Report, p. 21.
</pre>
    <p>
      question, <span class="pagenum">379</span><a name="link379" id="link379"></a>at
      least as high as those which can be obtained by industry of another
      description. It by no means follows, that a man feels an insurmountable
      dislike to the business of setting canes, because he will not set eanes
      for sixpence a day, when he can earn a shilling by making baskets. We
      might as well say, that the English people dislike agricultural labour,
      because Major Moody prefers making systems to making ditches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obvious as these considerations are, it is perfectly clear that Major
      Moody has overlooked them. From the Appendix to his own Report it appears,
      that in every West Indian island the wages of the artisan are much greater
      than those of the cultivator. In Tortola, for example, a carpenter earns
      three shillings sterling a day, a cartwright or a cooper four shillings
      and sixpence, a sawyer six shillings; an ablebodied field negro, under the
      most advantageous circumstances, nine pounds a year, about seven pence a
      day, allowing for holidays. And because a free African prefers six
      shillings to seven pence, we are told that he has a natural and invincible
      aversion to agriculture!&mdash;because he prefers wealth to poverty, we
      are to conclude that he prefers repose to wealth. Such is the mode of
      reasoning which the Major designates as the philosophy of labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, says the Major, all employments, excepting those of the cultivator
      and the domestic servant, are only occasional. There is little demand for
      the labour of the carpenter, the cooper, and the sawyer. Let us suppose
      the demand to be so incredibly small, that the carpenter can obtain work
      only one day in six, the cooper one day in nine, and the sawyer one day in
      twelve; still the amount of their earnings will be greater than if they
      broke clods almost daily through the whole year. Of two employments which
      yield equal wages, the inhabitants of all countries, both within and
      without the tropics, will choose that whieh requires the least labour
      Major Moody seems throughout his Report to imagine, that people in the
      temperate zone work for the sake of working; that they consider labour,
      not as an evil to be endured for the sake of a good produced by it, but as
      a blessing, from which the wages are a sort of drawback; that they would
      rather work three days for a shilling, than one day for half a crown. The
      case, he may be assured, is by no means such as he supposes. If he will
      make proper inquiries he will <span class="pagenum">380</span><a
      name="link380" id="link380"></a>learn, that, even where the thermometer
      stands at the lowest, no man will choose a laborious employment, when he
      can obtain equal remuneration with less trouble in another line. But it,
      is unnecessary to resort to this argument; for it is perfectly clear, on
      Major Moody&rsquo;s own showing, that the demand for mechanical industry, though
      occasional and small, is still sufficient to render the business of an
      artisan much more lucrative than that of a field labourer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have shown,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that the sugar-planter himself, obtaining 287
      days labour on the very cheapest terms, could not have afforded to give
      more than about 9l. per annum for labourers, and therefore, that he never
      could hope to induce any liberated African to work steadily for such
      wages, when the liberated African could obtain from 15l. to 21l. per annum
      by the irregular labour of occasionally cutting firewood, grass, or
      catching fish, &amp;c....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the most favourable view of the case; for the fact is, the
      sugar-planter, on the very best soils in Tortola, could only a fiord to
      give 91. per annum; but in soils of average fertility, he could only
      afford 6l. 15s. per annum to the labourer, even if the planter gave up all
      profits on his stock, consisting of lands, buildings, and machinery. If
      the liberated Negro would not labour steadily for 9l. per annum, it is
      clear he would be less likely to work for 6l. 15s. per annum; but if he
      did not work for less than that sum, the planter in Tortola could obtain
      no profit on stock, and consequently could have no motive for employing
      any person to work for such wages. The white race, being unable to work,
      must in this, as in all similar cases, perish, or abandon their country
      and property to the blacks, who can work, but who, as I have shown, are
      not likely to make use of more voluntary steady exertion than will afford
      the means of subsistence in the lowlands of the torrid zone, where the
      pleasure of repose forms so great an ingredient in the happiness of
      mankind, whether whites, blacks, or Indians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We really stand aghast at the extravagance of a writer who supposes that
      the principle which leads a man to prefer light labour and twenty-one
      pounds, to hard labour and six Bounds fifteen shillings, is a principle of
      which the operation is confined to the torrid zone! But the matter may be
      put on a very short issue. Let Major Moody find any tropical country in
      which the inhabitants prefer mechanical trades to field labour when higher
      advantages are offered to the field labourer than to the mechanic. He will
      then have done what he has not done hitherto. He will have adduced one
      fact bearing on the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the circumstances which we have been considering prove any thing, they
      appear to prove the inexpediency of the <span class="pagenum">381</span><a
      name="link381" id="link381"></a>coercive system. The effect of that system
      in the West Indies has been to produce a glut of agricultural labour, and
      a scarcity of mechanical dexterity. The discipline of a plantation may
      stimulate a sluggish body; but it has no tendency to stimulate a sluggish
      mind. It calls forth a certain quantity of muscular exertion; but it does
      not encourage that ingenuity which is necessary to the artisan. This is
      the only explanation which at present occurs to us of the enormous price
      which skilled labour fetches in a country in which the cultivator can
      barely obtain a subsistence. We offer it, however, with diffidence, as the
      result of a very hasty consideration of the subject. But it is with no
      feeling of diffidence that we pronounce the whole argument of the Major
      absurd. That he has convinced himself we do not doubt. Indeed he has given
      the best proof of sincerity: For he has acted up to his theory; and left
      us, we must confess, in some doubt whether to admire him more as an active
      or as a speculative politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the African apprentices emigrated from Tortola to the Danish
      island of St. Thomas, some with the consent of their masters, and others
      without it. Why they did so, is evident from the account which the Major
      himself gives. The wages were higher in St. Thomas than in Tortola. But
      such theorists as the Major are subject to illusions as strange as those
      which haunted Don Quixote. To the visionary Knight every inn was a castle,
      every ass a charger, and every basin a helmet. To the Major every fact,
      though explicable on ten thousand obvious suppositions, is a confirmation
      of his darling hypothesis. He gives the following account of his opinions
      and of his consequent measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The occupations followed by the apprentices in the Danish island of St.
      Thomas, on these occasions were generally the irregular and occasional
      industry of porters, servants on hoard vessels, &amp;e., in which they
      often got comparatively high wages, which enabled them to work for money
      at one time in order to live, without working for a longer or shorter
      period; such a mode of existence being more agreeable to them than steady
      and regular industry affording employment during the whole year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From this irregular application to certain kinds of labour and dislike to
      that of agriculture, it was my wish to turn the attention of the African
      apprentices, and therefore I was anxious to prevent their running away to
      the Danish island of St. Thomas, or being sent there. His Excellency
      Governor Van Seholton afforded me every facility in removing them; but
      they soon returned again. It will also be seen that in St. Thomas they
      were liable to be taken up and sold as slaves, it was actually the case
      with one apprentice. It is not undeserving of remark, that not one of the
      apprentices who thus withdrew themselves from Tortola, ever <span
      class="pagenum">382</span><a name="link382" id="link382"></a>hired
      themselves to agricultural labor for any fixed period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The occasional high wages in irregular kinds of industry, however
      uncertain, appear to have pleased them belter than the permanent rewards
      procured by an employment less exposed to uncertainty, but which required
      a steady exertion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What the permanent rewards of agricultural labour were in Tortola, we have
      seen. The planter would have found it ruinous on most estates to give more
      than six pounds fifteen shillings a year, or about fourpence a day.
      Unless, therefore, they were much higher in St. Thomas, it is surely not
      extraordinary that they did not induce these apprentices to quit the
      employments to which, not by their own choice, but by the orders of the
      Government, they had been trained, for a pursuit uncongenial to all their
      habits. How often is it that an Englishman, who has served his
      apprenticeship to an artisan, hires himself to agricultural labour when he
      can find work in his own line?
    </p>
    <p>
      But we will pass by the absurdity of condemning people for preferring high
      wages with little labour, to low wages with severe labour. We have other
      objections to make. The Major has told us that the African apprentices
      could not legally be employed in agriculture on the island of Tortola. If
      so, we wish to know how their dislike of agricultural labour could be
      their motive for quitting Tortola, or how, by bringing them back to
      Tortola, he could improve their habits in that respect? To bring a man by
      main force from a residence which he likes, and to place him in the hands
      of an employer acknowledged to be cruel, for fear that he may possibly be
      made a slave, seems to us also a somewhat curious proceeding, and deserves
      notice, as being the only indication of zeal for liberty which the Major
      appears to have betrayed during the whole course of his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major might perhaps be justified in exerting himself to recover those
      apprentices who had emigrated without the consent of their masters. But
      with regard to the rest, his conduct <span class="pagenum">383</span><a
      name="link383" id="link383"></a>appears to have been equally absurd and
      mischievous. He repeatedly tells us that Tortola is a poor island. It
      appears from the schedules, that he was in the habit of asking the masters
      and mistresses, whether their apprentices, after the term of service
      should have expired, would be able to support themselves. In the ease of
      some most respectable and industrious workmen, the answer was, that they
      possessed all the qualifications which would enable them to earn a
      livelihood; but that Tortola was too poor to afford them an adequate
      field: And this was evidently the cause which induced so many to transport
      themselves to St. Thomas. Of all the innumerable instances in which
      public, functionaries have exposed their ignorance by officiously meddling
      with matters of which individuals ought to be left to judge for
      themselves, we remember none more conspicuous than that which Major Moody
      has thus recorded against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seems the industry of these emigrants, and indeed of the free
      Blacks generally, is not regular or steady. These are words of which Major
      Moody is particularly fond, and which he generally honours with Italics.
      We have, throughout this article, taken the facts as he states them, and
      contented ourselves with exposing the absurdity of his inferences. We
      shall do so now. We will grant that the free blacks do not work so
      steadily as the slaves, or as the labourers in many other countries. But
      how does Major Moody connect this unsteadiness with the climate? To us it
      appears to be the universal effect of an advance in wages, an effeet not
      confined to tropical countries, but daily and hourly witnessed in England
      by every man who attends to the habits of the lower orders. Let us
      suppose, that an English manufacturer can provide himself with those
      indulgences which use has rendered necessary to his comfort for ten
      shillings a week, and that he ean earn ten shillings a week by working
      steadily twelve hours a day. In that case, he will probably work twelve
      hours a day. But let us suppose that the wages of his labour rise to
      thirty shillings. Will he still continue to work twelve hours a day, for
      the purpose of trebling his present enjoyments, or of laying up a hoard
      against bad tunes? Notoriously not. He will perhaps work four days in the
      week, and thus earn twenty shillings, a sum larger than that whieh he
      formerly obtained, but less than that which he might obtain if he chose to
      labour as he formerly laboured.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <span class="pagenum">384</span><a name="link384" id="link384"></a>the
      wages of the workman rise, he Everywhere takes out, if we may so express
      ourselves, some portion of the rise in the form of repose. This is the
      real explanation of that unsteadiness on which Major Moody dwells so much&mdash;an
      unsteadiness which cannot surprise any person who has ever talked with an
      English manufacturer, or ever heard the name of Saint Monday. It appears
      by his own report, that a negro slave works from Monday morning to
      Saturday night on the sugar grounds of Tortola, and receives what is
      equivalent to something less than half-a-crown in return, then he ceases
      to be a slave, and becomes his own master; and then he finds that by
      cutting firewood, an employment which requires no great skill, he can earn
      eight shillings and fourpence a week. By working every other day he can
      procure better food and better clothes than ever he had before. In no
      country from the Pole to the Equator, would a labourer under such
      circumstances work steadily. The Major considers it as a strange
      phenomenon, peculiar to the torrid zone, that these people lay up little
      against seasons of sickness and distress&mdash;as if this were not almost
      universally the case among the far more intelligent population of England&mdash;as
      if we did not regularly see our artisans thronging to the alehouse when
      wages are high, and to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop when they are low&mdash;as if
      we were not annually raising millions, in order to save the working
      classes from the misery which otherwise would be the consequence of their
      own improvidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not the advocates of idleness and imprudence. The question before
      us is, not whether it be desirable that men all over the world should
      labour more steadily than they now do; but whether the laws which regulate
      labour within the tropics differ from those which are in operation
      elsewhere. This is a question which never can be settled, merely by
      comparing the quantity of work done in different places. By pursuing such
      a course, we should establish a separate law of labour for every country,
      and for every trade in every country. The free African does not work so
      steadily as the Englishman. But the wild Indian, by the Major&rsquo;s own
      account, works still less steadily than the African. The Chinese labourer,
      on the other hand, works more steadily than the Englishman. In this
      island, the industry of the porter or the waterman, is less steady than
      the industry <span class="pagenum">385</span><a name="link385" id="link385"></a>of
      the ploughman. But the great general principle is the same in all. All
      will work extremely hard rather than miss the comforts to which they have
      been habituated; and all, when they find it possible to obtain their
      accustomed comforts with less than their accustomed labour, will not work
      so hard as they formerly worked, merely to increase them. The real point
      to be ascertained, therefore, is, whether the free African is content to
      miss his usual enjoyments, not whether he works steadily or not; for the
      Chinese peasant would work as irregularly as the Englishman, and the
      Englishman as irregularly as the negro, if this could be done without any
      diminution of comforts. Now, it does not appear from any passage in the v
      hole Report, that the free blacks are retrograding in their mode of
      living. It appears on the contrary, that their work, however irregular,
      does in fact enable them to live more comfortably than they ever did as
      slaves. The unsteadiness, therefore, of which they are accused, if it be
      an argument for coercing them, is equally an argument for coercing the
      spinners of Manchester and the grinders of Sheffield.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next ease which we shall notice is, that of the native Indians within
      the tropics. That these savages have a great aversion to steady labour,
      and that they have made scarcely any advances toward civilization we
      readily admit. Major Moody speaks on this subject with authority; for it
      seems that, when he visited one of their tribes, they forgot to boil the
      pot for him, and put him off with a speech, which he has reported at
      length, instead of a meal.1 He, as usual, attributes their habits to the
      heat of the climate. But let us consider that the Indians of North
      America, with much greater advantages, live in the same manner. A most
      enlightened and prosperous community has arisen in their vicinity. Many
      benevolent men have attempted to correct their roving propensities, and to
      inspire them with a taste for those comforts which industry alone can
      procure. They still obstinately adhere to their old mode of life. The
      independence, the strong excitement, the occasional periods of intense
      exertion, the long intervals of repose, have become delightful and almost
      necessary to them. It is well known that Europeans, who have lived among
      them for any length of time, are strangely fascinated by the pleasures of
      that state <span class="pagenum">386</span><a name="link386" id="link386"></a>of
      society, and even by its sufferings and hazards. Among ourselves, the
      Gypsey race, one of the most beautiful and intelligent on the face of the
      earth, has lived for centuries in a similar manner. Those singular
      outcasts have been surrounded on every side by the great works of human
      labour. The advantage&rsquo;s of industry were forced upon their notice. The
      roads on which they travelled, the hedges under which they rested, the
      hen-roosts which furnished their repast, the silver which crossed their
      palms&mdash;all must have constantly reminded them of the conveniences and
      luxuries which are to be obtained by steady exertion. They were persecuted
      under a thousand pretexts, whipped for vagrants, imprisoned for poachers,
      ducked for witches. The severest laws were enacted against them. To
      consort with them was long a capital offence. Yet a remnant of the race
      still preserves its peculiar language and manners&mdash;still prefers a
      tattered tent and a chance-meal of carrion to a warm house and a
      comfortable dinner. If the habits of the Indians of Guiana prove that
      slavery is necessary within the tropics, the habits of the Mohawks and
      Gypsies will equally prove, that it is necessary in the temperate zone.
      The heat cannot be the cause of that which is found alike in the coldest
      and in the hottest countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Moody gives a long account of the Maroon settlements near Surinam.
      These settlements were first formed by slaves, who fled from the
      plantations on the coast, about the year 1667. The society was, during the
      following century, augmented from time to time by fresh reinforcements of
      fugitive negroes. This supply, however, has now been for many years
      stopped. It is perfectly true, that these people were long contented with
      a bare subsistence, and that little of steady agricultural industry has
      ever existed amongst them. The Major again recurs to physical causes, and
      the heat of the sun. A better explanation may be given in one word,
      insecurity. During about one hundred years, the Maroons were absolutely
      run down like mad dogs. It appears from the work of Captain Stedman, to
      which the Major himself alludes, that those who fell into the hands of the
      whites were hung up by hooks thrust into their ribs, torn to pieces on the
      rack, or roasted on slow fires. They attempted to avoid the danger, by
      frequently changing, and carefully concealing their residence. The
      accidental crowing of a cock, <span class="pagenum">387</span><a
      name="link387" id="link387"></a>had brought destruction on a whole tribe.
      That a people thus situated should labour to acquire property which they
      could not enjoy&mdash;that they should engage in employments which would
      necessarily attach them to a particular spot, was not to be expected.
      Their habits necessarily became irregular and ferocious. They plundered
      the colony&mdash;they plundered each other&mdash;they lived by hunting and
      fishing. The only productions of the earth which they cultivated, were
      such as could be speedily reared, and easily concealed. But during the
      last fifty years, these tribes have enjoyed a greater degree of security;
      and from the statement of Major Moody, who has himself visited that
      country, and who, though a wretched logician, is an unexceptionable
      witness, it appears, that they are rapidly advancing in civilization; that
      they have acquired a sense of new wants, and a relish for new pleasures;
      that agriculture has taken a more regular form; and that the vices and
      miseries of savage life are disappearing together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young men among the Maroons acknowledged, that the conduct of the
      chiefs had become much better, in respect of not interfering with the
      wives of others, and that everybody now could have his own wife.&rdquo;.......
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I observed, that they had adopted the system of sometimes domesticating
      wild animals, and rearing those already domesticated for food; that
      instead of always boucaning their meats, like the Indians, they now often
      used salt when they could get it; and, finally, that instead of depending
      on the forests for fruits, or cultivating roots which were soon reaped,
      and conld easily be concealed, they had generally adopted the banana and
      plantain as a food, which requires about twelve months to produce its
      fruits, and the tree obtains a considerable height.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also found, that a certain degree of occasional industry had taken
      place among the Maroons. Some of these young men had devoted a few days in
      the year to cutting down trees which nature had planted. From such
      occasional labour they were enabled to procure finery for a favourite
      female, a better, gun, or a new axe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surely this statement is most encouraging. No sooner was security given to
      these Maroons, than improvement commenced. A single generation has
      sufficed to change these hunters into cultivators of the earth, to teach
      them the use of domestic animals, to awaken among them a taste for the
      luxuries and distinctions of polished societies. That their labour is
      still only occasional, we grant. But this, we cannot too often repeat, is
      not the question. If occasional labour <span class="pagenum">388</span><a
      name="link388" id="link388"></a>will supply the inhabitant of the
      temperate zone with comforts greater than those to which he is accustomed,
      he will labour only occasionally. These negroes are not only willing to
      work rather than forego their usual comforts, but are also willing to make
      some addition to their labour, for the sake of some addition to their
      comforts. Nothing more can be said for the labourers of any country. The
      principle which has made England and Holland what they are, is evidently
      at work in the thickets of Surinam.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the habits of the fugitives were altogether idle and irregular till
      within the last fifty years, is nothing to the purpose. How much of
      regular industry was formerly to be found among the outlawed moss-troopers
      of our Border, or in the proscribed elan of the Macgregors? Down to a very
      late period, a large part of the Scotch people were as averse to steady
      industry as any tribe of Maroons. In the year 1698, Fletcher of Saltonn
      called the attention of the Scottish Parliament to this horrible evil.
      &ldquo;This country,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;has always swarmed with such numbers of idle
      vagabonds as no laws could ever restrain. There are at this day in
      Scotland two hundred thousand people begging from door to door, living
      without any regard or subjection to the laws of the land, or to even those
      of God and nature. No magistrate could ever discover or be informed which
      way one in a hundred of these wretches died, or that ever they were
      baptised.&rdquo; He advises the Government to set them to work; but he strongly
      represents the difficulty of such an undertaking. That sort of people is
      so desperately wicked, such enemies of all work and labour, and, which is
      yet more amazing, so proud in esteeming their own condition above that
      which they will be sure to call slavery, that, unless prevented by the
      utmost industry and diligence, upon the first publication of any orders
      for putting in execution such a design, they will rather die with hunger
      in caves and dens, and murder their young children. Fletcher was a brave,
      honest, and sensible man. He had fought and suffered for liberty. Yet the
      circumstances of his country shook his faith in the true principles of
      government. He looked with dismay on the mountains occupied by lawless
      chiefs and their gangs, and the lowlands cursed by the depredations of
      some plunderers and the protection of others. Everywhere he saw swarms of
      robbers and beggars. He contrasted this desolate prospect <span
      class="pagenum">389</span><a name="link389" id="link389"></a>with the
      spectacle which Holland presented, the miracles which human industry had
      there achieved, a country rescued from the ocean, vast and splendid
      cities, ports crowded with ships, meadows cultivated to the highest point,
      canals along which hundreds of boats were constantly passing, mercantile
      houses of which the daily payments exceeded the whole rental of the
      Highlands, an immense population whose habits were sober and laborious,
      and who acquired their comforts, not by injuring, but by benefiting their
      neighbours. He did not sufficiently consider that this state of things
      sprung from the wisdom and vigour of a government, which insured to every
      man the fruits of his exertions, and protected equally the pleasures of
      every class, from the pipe of the mechanic to the picture-gallery and the
      tulip-garden of the Burgomaster;&mdash;that in Scotland, on the contrary,
      the police was feeble, and the gentry rich in men and destitute of money;
      that robbery was in consequence common; that people will not build barns
      to be burned, or rear cattle to be lifted; that insecurity produced
      idleness, and idleness crimes, that these crimes again augmented the
      insecurity from which they had sprung. He overlooked these circumstances,
      and attributed the evil to the want of coercion. He censured the wreak
      humanity of those fathers of the church who had represented slavery as
      inconsistent with Christianity. He cited those texts with which the
      controversies of our own times have rendered us so familiar. Finally, he
      proposed to convert the lower classes into domestic bondsmen. His
      arguments were at least as plausible as those of Major Moody. But how
      signally has the event refuted them! Slavery was not established in
      Scotland. On the contrary, the changes which have taken place there have
      been favourable to personal liberty. The power of the chiefs has been
      destroyed. Security has been given to the capitalist and to the labourer.
      Could Fletcher now revisit Scotland, he would find a country which might
      well bear a comparison with his favourite Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The History of the Maroons of Surinam appears to us strictly analogous to
      that of the Scottish peasantry. In both cases insecurity produced
      idleness. In both security produces industry. The African community
      indeed, in the middle of the last century was far more barbarous than any
      part of the Scotch nation has ever been since the dawn of authentic <span
      class="pagenum">390</span><a name="link390" id="link390"></a>history. Not
      one of the fugitives had ever been taught to read and write. The traces of
      civilization which they brought from the colony were very slight, and were
      soon effaced by the habits of a lawless and perilous life. Of late,
      however, their progress has been rapid. Judging of the future by the past,
      we entertain a strong hope that they will soon form a flourishing and
      respectable society. At all events, we are sure that their condition
      affords no ground for believing that the labourer, within the tropics,
      acts on principles different from those which regulate his conduct
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now come to the case of Hayti, a ease on which Major Moody and his
      disciples place the strongest reliance. The report tells us, that
      Toussaint, Christophe and Boyer, have all found it necessary to compel the
      free negroes of that island to employ themselves in agriculture&mdash;that
      exportation has diminished&mdash;that the quantity of coffee now produced
      is much smaller than that which was grown under the French government&mdash;that
      the cultivation of sugar is abandoned&mdash;that the Haytians have not
      only ceased to export that article, but have begun to import it&mdash;that
      the men indulge themselves in repose, and force the women to work for
      them; and, finally, that this dislike of labour can be explained only by
      the heat of the climate, and can be subdued only by coercion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we have to say, in the first place, that the proofs which the Major
      brings refute each other. If, as he states, the Haytians are coerced, and
      have been coerced during the la>t thirty years, their idleness maybe an
      excellent argument against slavery, but can be no argument against
      liberty. If it be said that the coercion employed in Hayti is not
      sufficiently severe, we answer thus:&mdash;We never denied, that of two
      kinds of coercion, the more severe is likely to be the more efficient. Men
      can be induced to work only by two motives, hope and fear; the former is
      the motive of the free labourer, the latter of the slave. We hold that, in
      the long run, hope will answer best. But we are perfectly ready to admit,
      that a strong fear will stimulate industry more powerfully than a weak
      fear. The case of llayti, therefore, can at most only prove that severe
      slavery answers its purpose better than lenient slavery. It can prove
      nothing for slavery against freedom. But the Major is not entitled to use
      two contradictory <span class="pagenum">391</span><a name="link391"
       id="link391"></a>arguments. One or the other he must abandon. It&rsquo; he
      chooses to reason on the decrees of Toussaint and Christophe, he has no
      right to talk of the decrease of production. If, on the other hand, he
      insists on the idleness of the Haytians, he must admit their liberty. If
      they are not free, their idleness can be no argument against freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we will do more than expose the inconsistency of the Major. We will
      take both suppositions successively, and show that neither of them can
      affect the present question.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, then, let it be supposed that a coercive system is established in
      Hayti. Major Moody seems to think that this fact, if admitted, is
      sufficient to decide the controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The annexed regulations,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;of Toussaint, Desformomi, and
      Christophe, as well as those of President Boyer, intended for people in
      circumstances similar to those of the liberated Africans, appear to prove
      practically that some such measures are necessary as those which I have
      submitted as the result of my own personal observation ami experience, in
      the control of human labour in different climes, and under various
      circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must altogether dissent from this doctrine. It does not appear to us
      quite self-evident, that every law which every government may choose to
      make is necessarily a wise law. We have sometimes been inclined to suspect
      that, even in this enlightened country, legislators have interfered in
      matters which should have been left to take their own course. An English
      Parliament formerly thought fit to limit the wages of labour. This
      proceeding does not perfectly satisfy us, that wages had previously been
      higher than they should have been. Elizabeth, unquestionably the greatest
      sovereign that ever governed England, passed those laws for the support of
      the poor, which, though in seeming and intention most humane, have
      produced more evil than all the cruelties of Aero and Maximin. We have
      just seen that, at the close of the seventeenth century, a most
      respectable and enlightened Scotch gentleman thought slavery the only cure
      for the maladies of his country. Christophe was not destitute of talent:-.
      Toussaint was a man of great genius and unblemished integrity, a brave
      soldier, and in many respects a wise statesman. But both these men had
      been slaves. Both were ignorant of history and political economy. That
      idleness <span class="pagenum">392</span><a name="link392" id="link392"></a>and
      disorders should follow a general civil war, was perfectly natural. That
      rulers, accustomed to a system of compulsory labour, should think such a
      system the only cure for those evils, is equally natural. But what
      inference can be drawn from such circumstances?
    </p>
    <p>
      The negligence with which Major Moody has arranged his Appendix, is most
      extraordinary. He has, with strange inconsistency, given us no copy of the
      decree of Toussaint in the original, and no translation of the decree of
      Christophe. The decree of Boyer, the most important of the three, he has
      not thought fit to publish at all; though he repeatedly mentions it in
      terms which seem to imply that he has seen it. Our readers are probably
      aware, that the decree of Toussaint, or rather the Major&rsquo;s translation of
      it, was retouched by some of the statesmen of Jamaica, docked of the first
      and last paragraphs, which would at once have betrayed its date, and sent
      over by the Assembly to England, as a new law of President Boyer. This
      forgery, the silliest and most impudent that has been attempted within our
      remembrance, was at once exposed. The real decree, if there be such a
      decree, is not yet before the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decree of Toussaint was issued in a time of such extreme confusion,
      that even if we were to admit its expediency, which we are very far from
      doing, we should not be bound to draw any general conclusion from it. All
      the reasonings which Major Moody founds on the decree of Christophe, maybe
      refuted by this simple answer&mdash;that decree lays at least as many
      restraints on the capitalist as on the labourer. It directs him to provide
      machinery and mills. It limits the amount of Ins live-stock. It prescribes
      the circumstances under which he may form new plantations of coffee. It
      enjoins the manner in which he is to press his canes and to clean his
      cotton. The Major reasons: Christophe compelled the field-negroes to work.
      Hence it follows, that men who live in hot climates will not cultivate the
      soil steadily without compulsion. We may surely say, with equal justice,
      Christophe prescribed the manner in which the proprietor was to employ his
      capital, it is, therefore, to be inferred, that a capitalist in a hot
      climate cannot judge of his own interests, and that the government ought
      to take the management of his concerns out of his hands. If the Major will
      not adopt this conclusion, he must abandon <span class="pagenum">393</span><a
      name="link393" id="link393"></a>his own. All our readers will admit, that
      a Prince who could lay the capitalists under such restrictions as those
      which we have mentioned, must have been ignorant of political science, and
      prone to interfere in cases where legislative interference is foolish and
      pernicious. What conclusion, then, can be justly drawn from the restraints
      imposed by such a ruler on the freedom of the peasant?
    </p>
    <p>
      We have thus disposed of the first hypothesis, namely, that the Haytians
      are coerced. We will proceed to the second. Let it be supposed, that the
      Haytians are not coerced. In that case we say, that if they do not export
      as much as formerly, it will not necessarily follow that they do not work
      as much as formerly; and that, if they do not work as much as formerly, it
      still will not follow that their idleness proceeds from physical causes,
      or forms any exception to the general principles which regulate labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first great cause which depresses the industry of the Haytians, is the
      necessity of keeping up large and costly establishments. All who, since
      the expulsion of the French, have governed that country, have wisely and
      honourably sacrificed every other consideration to the preservation of
      independence. Large armies have been kept up. A considerable part of the
      population has consequently been supported in an unproductive employment;
      and a heavy burden has been laid on the industry of the rest. Major Moody
      quotes the following passage from the narrative of a most respectable and
      benevolent American, Mr. Dewey:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throughout the island the women perform the principal part of the labour
      in the field and in the house.... I was often moved with pity for their
      lot, though I rejoiced that the burden was now voluntary, and admired the
      spirit of women who could so readily perform the work of the men, that the
      men may be employed in the defence and preservation of their liberties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major pounces on the fact stated by Mr. Dewey; but, with the amiable
      condescension of a superior nature, gently corrects his inferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Mr. Dewey, and pious persons like him, do state the facts which he
      observed correctly, I am quite convinced: but when he, and those who
      reason in his manner, assign causes as solely producing the effect, it is
      then that error glides into their statements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We are not so completely convinced as the Major seems to <span
      class="pagenum">394</span><a name="link394" id="link394"></a>be, that all
      pious persons state correctly such facts as Mr. Dewey has observed: but we
      are sure, that Mr. Dewey must be the most ungrateful of men, if he is not
      grateful for such compliments. Indeed, the style which the Major always
      adopts towards philanthropists reminds us of Dogberry patting Verges on
      the back:&mdash;&ldquo;A good old man. Sir! he will be talking. Well said,
      i&rsquo;faith, neighbour. An two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An
      honest soid, i&rsquo;faith, as ever broke bread. But God is to be worshipped.
      All men are not alike.&rdquo; But we must go on with the argument of our
      philosophical commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any person who has travelled among people in a backward state of
      knowledge and social civilization, people who never experienced what
      slavery was, must have observed, as I have done, that the burden of
      agricultural labour is generally imposed on the females, by the arbitrary
      power exercised over them by the males....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whilst an examination into the actual population of Hayti, and the real
      number of the males actually withdrawn from agricultural pursuits for
      those of military service, at the time Mr. Dewey made his observations,
      would show, that, though the cause assigned by him might have some effect,
      that, in point of fact, a more powerful influence would probably be found
      in the action of causes springing from a different source than that
      assigned by him as the true cause; and whilst these other powerful causes
      are left in action, little practical good is effected by the removal of a
      minor influence.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not time to notice the innumerable beauties of this headless and
      endless sentence, in which a double allowance of thats compensates for the
      absence of a nominative case and a verb:&mdash;those who study the works
      of the Major must take such grammar as they can get, and be thankful. But,
      does be advance any reason, or the shadow of tiny reason, for dissenting
      from the opinion formed by a man whose honesty he acknowledges, on a point
      on which it is scarcely possible to be mistaken? No man of common sense
      can live three days in a country without finding out, whether it is by
      idleness, or by military duties, that the males are prevented from
      working. But Major Moody reasons thus&mdash;Savages, from their propensity
      to indolence, make their women work for them. The Haytians make their
      women work for them; therefore the Haytians are indolent savages;&mdash;an
      exquisite specimen of syllogistic reasoning! Horses are quadrupeds: but a
      pig is a quadruped; therefore a pig is a horse. The
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Ibid. p. 39.
</pre>
    <p>
      dullest <span class="pagenum">395</span><a name="link395" id="link395"></a>of
      the gravediggers in Hamlet would have been ashamed of such an argal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major surely does not mean to deny, that, in civilized and industrious
      nations, circumstances similar to those which exist in Hayti, have
      compelled the women to engage in agricultural labour. History abounds with
      such instances. When, fourteen years ago, the Prussians rose against the
      French, almost the whole harvest of Silesia and Upper Saxony was gathered
      in by females. The conscriptions of Buonaparte frequently produced the
      same effect. The Major says, indeed, or rather we, endowing his purposes
      with Syntax, say for him, that if the numbers of the Haytian people and of
      the Haytian army were ascertained, the causes assigned by Mr. Dewey would
      be found to have produced only part of the effect. But what evidence does
      he offer? Where are his facts, and his reasonings on these facts? Does he
      know what the population of Hayti may be? Does he know how large its army
      may be? If he knows, why does he not tell us? If he does not know, how can
      he tell what might be the result of an examination into those particulars?
      It is something too much that a writer, who, when he tries to demonstrate,
      never demonstrates any thing but his own ignorance of the art of
      reasoning, should expect to be implicitly believed, when he merely
      dogmatizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We grant, that the Haytians do not rear any great quantity of sugar. But
      can this circumstance be explained only by supposing that they are averse
      to the labour necessary for that purpose? When capital is withdrawn from a
      particular trade, a political economist is commonly inclined to suspect
      that the profits are smaller than those which may be obtained in other
      lines of business. Now, it is a notorious fact, that the profits which the
      cultivation of sugar yields are, in all our West Indian islands, extremely
      low; that the business is carried on only because a large quantity of
      capital has already been fixed in forms useless for every other purpose;
      and that, if this fixed capital were to be suddenly destroyed, no fresh
      investment would take place. A man who has purchased a costly apparatus
      for the purpose of carrying on a particular manufacture, will not
      necessarily change his business because he finds that his gains are
      smaller than those which he might obtain elsewhere, he will generally
      prefer a small profit to a dead loss, and rather take two per cent upon
      <span class="pagenum">396</span><a name="link396" id="link396"></a>his
      first investment than let that investment perish altogether, suffer his
      machinery to be idle, and turn the remains of his fortune to a pursuit in
      which he might make five per cent. This, we believe, is the only cause
      which keeps up the cultivation of sugar in Jamaica and Antigua.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Hayti this cause has ceased to operate. Most of the fixed capital
      necessary for the sugar-trade was destroyed by the war which followed the
      liberation of the negroes. The machinery which remained was employed as
      formerly. But it was not replaced as it fell to decay. This at once
      explains the gradual decrease of production. A similar decrease, from
      similar causes, is taking place in our oldest colonies. But let us even
      suppose that the cultivation of sugar was likely, under ordinary
      circumstances, to flourish in Hayti, it still remains to be considered
      what security capital invested in that business would have enjoyed. A
      short time back it seemed by no means improbable that France would assert
      her rights to the sovereignty of the island by arms. In the year 1814, the
      strongest apprehensions were entertained. A murderous and devastating war,
      a war in which quarter would neither have been given or taken, was to be
      expected. The plan of defence which the rulers of ti contemplated was
      suited to so terrible a crisis. It was intended to turn the coast into a
      desert, to set fire to the buildings, to tall back on the interior
      fastnesses of the country, and by constant skirmishes, by hunger, and by
      the effects of a climate so fatal to Europeans, to wear out the invading
      army. This design was avowed by the Government in publications which have
      found their way to England. It was justified by circumstances, and it
      could scarcely have failed of success. But it is evident that the remotest
      prospect of such an emergency would alone have deterred any capitalist
      from sinking his property in the extensive and valuable machinery
      necessary to a sugar-planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that there is a diminution in the quantity of coffee exported
      from Hayti. But the cause of the diminution is obvious. The taxes on that
      article are exorbitantly high. The territorial impost raised on the
      plantation, and the customs which must be paid previous to exportation,
      make up a duty of sixty per cent, on the prime cost. If the Haytians are
      to be free, they must have an army. If they are to have an army, they must
      raise money; and this may possibly <span class="pagenum">397</span><a
      name="link397" id="link397"></a>be the best way of raising it. But it is
      evidently impossible that a commodity thus burdened can maintain a
      competition with the produce of countries where no taxes exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      We therefore think it by no means improbable that the Haytians may have
      abandoned the cultivation of sugar and coffee, not from idleness, but from
      prudence; that they may have been as industriously employed as their
      enslaved ancestors, though in a different manner. All the testimony which
      we have ever been able to procure tends to prove that they are at least
      industrious enough to live comfortably, and multiply rapidly under the
      weight of a very heavy taxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have shown that the decrease in the exports of Hayti does not
      necessarily prove a decrease in the industry of the people. But we also
      maintain, that, even if we were to admit that the Haytians work less
      steadily than formerly, Major Moody has no right to attribute that
      circumstance to the influence of climate. His error in this and in many
      other parts of his work proceeds from an utter ignorance of the habits of
      labourers in the temperate zone. What those habits are, we have already
      stated. If an English labourer, who lias hitherto been unable to obtain
      the enjoyments to which he is accustomed without working three hundred
      days a year, should find himself able to obtain those enjoyments by
      working a hundred days a year, he will not continue to work three hundred
      days a year. He will make some addition to his pleasures, but he will
      abate largely of his exertions. He will probably work only on the
      alternate days. The ease of the Haytian is the same. As a slave he worked
      twelve months in the year, and received perhaps as much as he would have
      been able to raise in one month, if he had worked on his own account. He
      was liberated&mdash;he found that, by working for two months, he could
      procure luxuries of which he had never dreamed. If he worked unsteadily,
      he did only what an Englishman, in the same circumstances, would have
      done. In order to prove that labour in Hayti follows a law different from
      that which is in operation among ourselves, it is necessary to prove, not
      merely that the Haytian works unsteadily, but that he will forego comforts
      to which he is accustomed, rather than work steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Major Moody has not even asserted of the Haytians, or <span
      class="pagenum">398</span><a name="link398" id="link398"></a>of any other
      class of tropical labourers. He has, therefore, altogether failed to show,
      that the natives of the torrid zone cannot be safely left to the influence
      of those principles which have most effectually promoted civilization in
      Europe. If the law of labour be everywhere the same, and he has said
      nothing which induces us to doubt that it is so, that unsteadiness of
      which he speaks will, at least in its extreme degree, last only for a
      time, which, compared with the life of a nation, is but as a day in the
      life of man. The luxuries of one generation will become the necessaries of
      the next. As new desires are awakened, greater exertions will be
      necessary. This cause, cooperating with that increase of population of
      which the Major himself admits the effect, will, in less than a century,
      make the llayti an labourer what the English labourer now is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last case which we shall consider is, that of the free negroes who
      emigrated from North America to llayti. They were in number about six
      thousand. President Boyer undertook to defray the whole expense of their
      passage, and to support them for four months after their arrival&mdash;a
      clear proof that the people of Hayti are industrious enough to place at
      the disposal of the Government funds more than sufficient to defray its
      ordinary charges. We give the sixth and seventh articles of Boyer&rsquo;s
      instruction to the agent employed by him on this occasion, as Major Moody
      states them. It is on these that his whole argument turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Article VI.&mdash;To regulate better the interests of the emigrants, it
      will be proper to let them know in detail, what the government of the
      republic is disposed to do, to assure their future well-being and that of
      their children, on the sole condition of their being good and industrious
      citizens. You are authorized, in concert with the agents of the different
      societies, and before civil authority, to make arrangements with heads of
      families, or other emigrants who can unite twelve people able to work, and
      also to stipulate that the government will give them a portion of land
      sufficient to employ twelve persons, and on which may be raised coffee,
      cotton, maize, peas and other vegetables and provisions; and after they
      have well improved the said quantity of land which will not be less than
      thirty-six acres in extent, government will give a perpetual title to the
      said land to these twelve people, their heirs, and assigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Article VII.&mdash;Those of the emigrants who prefer applying themselves
      individually to the culture of the earth, either by renting lands already
      improved, which they will till, or by working in the field to share the
      produce with the proprietor, must also engage themselves by a legal act
      that, on arriving in llayti, they will make the above mentioned <span
      class="pagenum">399</span><a name="link399" id="link399"></a>arrangements;
      and this they must do before judges of the peace; so that, on their
      arrival here, they will be obliged to apply themselves to agriculture, and
      not be liable to become vagrants.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      On these passages the Major reasons thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Hayti, even at present, tinder the judicious government of President
      Boyer, we find the free and intelligent American Blacks receiving land for
      nothing, having their expenses paid, and the produce of the land to be for
      their own advantage, obliged, by a legal act, to apply themselves to a
      kind of labour which is manifestly and clearly intended to better their
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should a free man be thus obliged to act in a manner which the most
      ignorant person might discover was a duty incumbent on him, and that the
      result would be for his advantage? The legal act and its penalties, after
      such a grant of land, would appear pre-eminently absurd in England.&rdquo; (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      We, for our own parts, can conceive nothing more preeminently absurd, than
      for a man to quote and comment on what he has never read. This is clearly
      the case with the Major. The emigrants who were to be obliged by a legal
      act to apply themselves to labour, were not those who were to receive land
      for nothing, but those who were to rent it, or to hire themselves out as
      labourers under others.. The Major has applied the provisions of the
      Seventh Article to the class mentioned in the Sixth. So disgraceful an
      instance of carelessness we never saw in any official document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the President acted well or ill, is not the question. The
      principle on which he proceeded cannot be mistaken. He was about to
      advance a considerable sum for the purpose of transporting these people to
      Hayti. He appears, as far as we can judge from these instructions, to have
      exacted no security from the higher and most respectable class. But he
      thought it probable, we suppose, that many of those idle and profligate
      persons who abound in all great cities, and who are peculiarly likely to
      abound in a degraded caste, beggars and thieves, the refuse of the North
      American bridewells, might accept his proposals, merely that they might
      live for some months at free costs, and then return to their old habits.
      He therefore naturally required some assurance that the poorer emigrants
      intended to support themselves by their industry before he would agree to
      advance their subsistence.

</pre>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">400</span><a name="link400" id="link400"></a>Major
      proceeds thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Lordship may observe, in the instructions of the President, that
      onlv certain modes of rewarding the labour of the free American Black are
      mentioned, viz. rentin&rsquo;; land already improved, working in the field to
      share the produce with the labourer, or, by being proprietors of land, to
      cultivate on their own account without either rent or purchase, having
      land from the free gift of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ordinary mode of rewarding the labourer by the payment of wages. as
      in England or the Last Indies, where the country is fully peopled, is
      never once mentioned or alluded to by President Boyer, who may be fairly
      supposed to understand the situation of the country which he governs.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of the Tytians, we hope that Boyer understands the country
      which he governs better than the Major understands the subject on which he
      writes. Who before, ever thought of mentioning the renting of land as a
      mode of rewarding the labourer? The renting of land is a transaction
      between the proprietor of the soil and the capitalist. Can Major Moody
      possibly imagine, that, in any part of the world, the labourer, as a
      labourer, pays rent, or receives it? He surely must know, that those
      emigrants who rented land, must have rented it in the capacity, not of
      labourers, but of capitalists; that they must have paid the rent out of
      the profits of their stock, not out of the gains of their labour; that
      even when a man works on his own account, the gains of his labour, though
      not generally called wages, are wages to all intents and purposes, and
      though popularly confounded with his profits, follow a law altogether
      different. But Boyer, says Major Moody, never mentions wages. How can
      wages be better defined, than as the share of the produce allowed to the
      labourer? Does Major Moody conceive that wages can be paid only in money,
      or that money wages represent any thing but that share of the produce of
      which the President speaks? he goes on, however, floundering deeper and
      deeper in absurdity at every step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the present constitution of Hayti, as administered by President Boyer,
      in &ldquo;Titre sur l&rsquo;Lrat Politique des Citoyens,&rdquo; I find, under the act, that
      the rights of citizenship are suspended, as regards domestics working for
      wages (par l&rsquo;etât de domestique à gages), in that very republican
      country, where a person, ignorant of the effect of physical causes, would
      naturally conclude that it would be most unjust to deprive a man of his
      right of citizenship, because he preferred one mode of subsisting himself
      to another, which the Government wished to encourage.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Second Part of Major Moody&rsquo;s Report, p. 32.
</pre>
    <p>
      Physical <span class="pagenum">401</span><a name="link401" id="link401"></a>causes
      again! We should like to know whether these physical causes operate in
      France. In the French Constitution of the year 1791, we find the following
      Article.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be an active citizen, it is necessary not to be in a menial situation,
      namely, that of a servant receiving wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems, therefore, that this law which, in the opinion of Major Moody,
      nothing but the heat of the torrid zone will explain&mdash;this law, which
      any person, ignorant of physical causes, would consider as grossly unjust,
      is copied from the Institutions of a great and enlightened European
      nation. AYe can assure him, that a little knowledge of history is now and
      then very useful to a person who undertakes to speculate on politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must return for a moment to the North American emigrants. Much
      mismanagement seems to have taken place with respect to them. They were
      received with cordiality, and pampered with the utmost profusion, by the
      liberal inhabitants of Port-au-Prince. They had left a country where they
      had always been treated as the lowest of mankind; they had landed in a
      country where they were overwhelmed with caresses and presents. The heads
      of many were turned by the change. Many came from cities, and, totally
      unaccustomed to agricultural labour, found themselves transported into the
      midst of an agricultural community. The Government, with more generosity
      than wisdom, suffered them to eat their rations in idleness. This is a
      short summary of the narrative of Dr. Dewey, who was himself on the spot.
      He continues thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although these and other circumstances damped the ardour of some of the
      emigrants, and rendered the in dissatisfied with their situation, yet I
      have uniformly found the industrious and the most respectable, and such as
      were fitted to be cultivators of the soil, contented with their condition
      and prospects, and convinced that great advantages were put within their
      reach. By far the greater part of the emigrants I saw were satisfied with
      their change of country, and many were so much pleased that they would not
      return on any consideration, and said, that they never felt at home
      before, that they have never felt what it was to be in a country where
      their colour was not despised. But these were such as went out expecting
      to meet difficulties and not to live in the city; and they are so
      numerous, and pursuing their course with so much enterprise, that I feel
      there is no more reason for surprise at the industry and contentment which
      they exhibit, than at the dissatisfaction which has brought back 200, and
      will perhaps bring back a few more.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Second Part of Major Moody&rsquo;s Report, p. 35. 26
</pre>
    <p>
      All <span class="pagenum">402</span><a name="link402" id="link402"></a>this
      statement the Major quotes as triumphantly as if it were favourable to his
      hypothesis, or as if it were not of itself sufficient to refute every
      syllable that he has written. Those who came from towns shrunk from
      agricultural labour. Is this a circumstance peculiar to any climate? Lei
      Major Moody try the same experiment in this country with the footmen and
      shopmen of London, and see what success he will have. But those who were
      accustomed to tillage, applied themselves to it with vigour; and this
      though they came from a cold country, and must therefore be supposed to
      have been peculiarly sensible of the influence of tropical heat. It is
      clear, therefore, that their desire to better their Condition surmounted
      that love of repose which, according to the new philosophy of labour, can,
      in warm, fertile, and thinly peopled countries, be surmounted only by the
      fear of punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now gone through the principal topics of which the Major has
      treated. We have done him more than justice. We have arranged his chaotic
      mass of facts and theories; we have frequently translated his language
      into English; we have refrained from quoting the exquisitely ridiculous
      similitudes and allusions with which he has set off his reasonings; we
      have repeatedly taken on ourselves the burden of the proof in cases where,
      by all the rules of logic, we might have imposed it on him. Against us, he
      cannot resort to his ordinary modes of defence. He cannot charge us with
      ignorance of local circumstances, for almost all the facts on which we
      have argued are taken from his own report. He cannot sneer at us as pious,
      benevolent people, misled by a blind hatred of slavery, eager in the
      pursuit of a laudable, end, but ignorant of the means by which alone it
      can be obtained. We have treated the question as a question purely
      scientific. We have reasoned as if we had been reasoning, not about men
      and women, but about spinning-jeanies and power-looms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Point by point we have refuted his whole theory. We have shown that the
      phenomena which he attributes to the atmosphere of the torrid zone, are
      found in the most temperate climates; and that, if coercion be desirable
      in the case of the West Indian labourer, the stocks, the branding iron,
      and the forty stripes save one, ought to be, without delay introduced into
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      There <span class="pagenum">403</span><a name="link403" id="link403"></a>are
      still some parts of the subject on which, if the article were not already
      too long, we should wish to dwell. Coercion, according to Major Moody, is
      necessary only in those tropical countries in which the population does
      not press on the means of subsistence. He holds, that the multiplication
      of the species will at length render it superfluous. It would be easy to
      show that this remedy is incompatible with the evil; that the deadly
      labour, or, as he would call it, the steady labour, which the West Indian
      sugar-planter exacts, destroys life with frightful rapidity; that the only
      colonics in which the slaves keep up their numbers are those in which the
      cultivation of sugar has altogether ceased, or has greatly diminished; and
      that, in those settlements in which it is extensively and profitably
      carried on, the population <i>decreases</i> at a rate which portends its
      speedy extinction. To say, therefore, that the negroes of the sugar
      colonies must continue slaves till their numbers shall have greatly
      increased, is to say, in decent and humane phraseology, that they must
      continue slaves till the whole race is exterminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some future time we may resume this subject. We may then attempt to
      explain a principle, which, though established by long experience, still
      appears to many people paradoxical, namely, that a rise in the price of
      sugar, while it renders the slave more valuable, tends at the same time to
      abridge his life. We may then also endeavour to show how completely such a
      system is at variance with the principles on which alone colonization can
      be defended. When a great country scatters, in some vast and fertile
      wilderness, the seeds of a civilized population, fosters and protects the
      infant community through the period of helplessness, and rears it into a
      mighty nation, the measure, is not only beneficial to mankind, but may
      answer as a mercantile speculation. The sums which were advanced for the
      support and defence of a few emigrants, struggling with difficulties and
      surrounded by dangers, are repaid by an extensive and lucrative commerce
      with flourishing and populous regions, which, but for those emigrants,
      would still have been inhabited only by savages and beasts of prey. Thus,
      in spite of all the errors which our ancestors committed, both during
      their connexion with the North American provinces, and at the time of
      separation, we are inclined to think that England has, on the whole,
      obtained great benefits from them. From our dominions in New South Wales,
      if judiciously governed, great advantages may <span class="pagenum">404</span><a
      name="link404" id="link404"></a>also be derived. But what advantage can we
      derive from colonies in which the population, under a cruel and grinding
      system of oppression, is rapidly wasting away? The planter, we must
      suppose, knows his own interest. If he chooses to wear his slave to death
      by exacting from him an exorbitant quantity of work, we must suppose that
      he gains more by the work than he loses by the death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his capital is not the only capital which has been sunk in those
      countries. Who is to repay the English nation for the treasure which has
      been expended in governing and defending them? If we had made Jamaica what
      we have made Massachusetts, if we had raised up in Guiana a population
      like that of New York, we should indeed have been repaid. But of such a
      result under the present system there is no hope. It is not improbable
      that some who are now alive may see the last negro disappear from our
      Transatlantic possessions. After having squandered a sum, which, if
      judiciously employed, might have called into existence a great, rich, and
      enlightened people, which might have spread our arts, our laws, and our
      language from the banks of the Maragnon to the Mexican sea, we shall again
      leave our territories deserts as we found them, without one memorial to
      prove that a civilized man ever set foot on their shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must absolutely conclude. This subject is far too extensive to be
      fully discussed at present; and we have another duty to perform. With the
      Major we began, and with the Major we mean to end. That he is a very
      respectable officer, and a very respectable man, we have no reason to
      doubt. But we do, with all seriousness and good-will assure him, that he
      has no vocation to be a philosopher. If he has set his heart on
      constructing theories, we are sorry for him; for we cannot flatter him
      with the faintest hope of success. A few undigested facts, and a few long
      words that mean nothing, are but a slender stock for so extensive a
      business. For a time he may play the politician among philosophers, and
      the philosopher among politicians. He may bewilder speculative men with
      the cant of office, and practical men with the cant of metaphysics. But at
      last he must find his level. He is very fit to be a collector of facts, a
      purveyor of details to those who know how to reason on them; but he is no
      more qualified to speculate on political science, than a bricklayer is to
      rival Palladio, or a nurseryman to confute Linuæus.

      apologize to our readers for prefixing to this article the name of such a
      publication. The two numbers which lie on our table contain nothing which
      could be endured, even at a dinner of the Pitt Club, unless, as the
      newspapers express it, the hilarity had been continued to a very late
      hour. We have met, we confess, with nobody who has ever seen them; and,
      should our account excite any curiosity respecting them, we fear that an
      application to the booksellers will already be too late. Some tidings of
      them may perhaps be obtained from the trunk-makers. In order to console
      our readers, however, under this disappointment, we will venture to assure
      them, that the only subject on which the reasonings of these Antijacobin
      Reviewers throw any light, is one in which we take very little interest&mdash;the
      state of their own understandings; and that the only feeling which their
      pathetic appeals have excited in us, is that of deep regret for our four
      shillings, which are gone and will return no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a very cleanly, or a very agreeable task, to rake up from the
      kennels of oblivion the remains of drowned abortions, which have never
      opened their eyes on the day, or even been heard to whimper, but have been
      at once transferred from the filth in which they were littered, to the
      filth with which they are to rot. But unhappily we have no choice. Bad as
      this work is, it is quite as good as any which has appeared against the
      present administration. We have looked everywhere, without being able to
      find any antagonist who can possibly be as much ashamed of defeat as we
      shall be of victory.

    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">406</span><a name="link406" id="link406"></a>manner
      in which the influence of the press has, at this crisis, been exercised,
      is indeed, very remarkable. All the talent has been on one side. With an
      unanimity which, as Lord Londonderry wisely supposes, can be ascribed only
      to a dexterous use of the secret-service money, the able and respectable
      journals of the metropolis have all supported the new government. It has
      been attacked, on the other hand, by writers who make every cause which
      they espouse despicable or odious,&mdash;by one paper which owes all its
      notoriety to its reports of the slang uttered by drunken lads who are
      brought to Bow Street for breaking windows&mdash;by another, which barely
      contrives to subsist on intelligence from butlers, and advertisements from
      perfumers. With these are joined all the scribblers who rest their claim
      to orthodoxy and loyalty on the perfection to which they have carried the
      arts of ribaldry and slander. What part these gentlemen would take in the
      present contest, seemed at first doubtful. We feared, for a moment, that
      their servility might overpower their malignity, and that they would be
      even more inclined to flatter the powerful than to calumniate the
      innocent. It turn-out that we were mistaken; and we are most thankful for
      it. They have been kind enough to spare us the discredit of their
      alliance. We know not how we should have borne to be of the same party
      with them. It is bad enough, God knows, to be of the same species.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writers of the book before us, who are also, we believe, the great
      majority of its readers, can scarcely be said to belong to this class.
      They rather resemble those snakes with which Indian jugglers perform so
      many curious tricks: The bags of venom are left, but the teeth are
      extracted. That they might omit nothing tending to make them ridiculous.
      they have adopted a title on which no judicious writer would have
      ventured; and challenged comparison with one of the most ingenious and
      amusing volumes in our language. Whether they have assumed this name on
      the principle which influenced Mr. Shandy in christening his children, or
      from a whim similar to that which induced the proprietors of the most
      frightful Hottentot that ever lived, to give her the name of Venus, we
      shall not pretend to decide; but we would seriously advise them to
      consider, whether it is for their interest, that people should be reminded
      of the celebrated imitations of Darwin and Kotzebue, while they are
      reading <span class="pagenum">407</span><a name="link407" id="link407"></a>such
      parodies on the Bible as the following:&mdash;&ldquo;In those days, a strange
      person shall appear in the land, and he shall cry to the people. Behold, I
      am possessed by the Demon of Ultra-Liberalism; I have received the gift of
      incoherence; I am a political philosopher, and a professor of paradoxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We would also, with great respect, ask the gentleman who has lampooned Mr.
      Canning in such Drydenian couplets as this: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"When he said if they would but let him in, <br /><span
      class="indent20">He would never try to turn them out again,&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      whether his performance gains much by being compared with New Morality?
      and, indeed, whether such satire as this is likely to make anybody laugh
      but himself, or to make anybody wince but his publisher?

      But we must take leave of the <i>New Antijacobin Review</i>; and we do so,
      hoping that we have secured the gratitude of its conductors. We once heard
      a schoolboy relate, with evident satisfaction and pride, that he had been
      horsewhipped by a Duke: we trust that our present condescension will be as
      highly appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not for the purpose of making a scarecrow of a ridiculous
      publication, that we address our readers at the present important crisis.
      We are convinced, that the cause of the present Ministers is the cause of
      liberty, the cause of toleration, the cause of political science,&mdash;the
      cause of the people, who are entitled to expect from their wisdom and
      liberality many judicious reforms,&mdash;the cause of the aristocracy,
      who, unless those reforms be adopted, must inevitably be the victims of a
      violent and desolating revolution. We are convinced, that the government
      of the country was never intrusted to men who more thoroughly understood
      its interest, or were more sincerely disposed to promote it&mdash;to men
      who, in forming their arrangements, thought so much of what they could <i>do</i>,
      and so little of what they could <i>get</i>. On the other side, we see a
      party which, for ignorance, intemperance, and inconsistency, has no
      parallel in our annals,&mdash;which, as an Opposition, we really think, is
      a scandal to the nation, and, as a Ministry, would speedily be its ruin.
      Under these circumstances, we think it our duty to give our best support
      to those with whose power are inseparably bound up all the dearest
      interests of the community,&mdash;the freedom <span class="pagenum">408</span><a
      name="link408" id="link408"></a>of worship, of discussion, and of trade,&mdash;our
      honour abroad, and our tranquillity at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In undertaking the defence of the Ministers, we feel ourselves enbarrassed
      by one difficulty: we are unable to comprehend distinctly of what they are
      accused. A statement of facts may be contradicted; but the gentlemen of
      the Opposition do not deal in statements. Reasonings may be refuted; but
      the gentlemen of the Opposition do not reason. There is something
      impassive and elastic about their dulness, on which all the weapons of
      controversy are thrown away. It makes no resistance, and receives no
      impression. To argue with it, is like stabbing the water, or cudgelling a
      woolpack. Buonaparte is said to have remarked, that the English soldiers
      at Waterloo did not know when they were beaten. The Duke of Wellington,
      equally fortunate in polities and in war, has the rare felicity of being
      supported a second time by a force of this description,&mdash;men whose
      desperate hardihood in argument sets all assailants at defiance,&mdash;who
      fight on, though borne down on every side by overwhelming proofs, rush
      enthusiastically into the mouth of an absurdity, or stake themselves with
      cool intrepidity on the horn of a dilemma. We doubt whether this
      unconquerable pertinacity be quite as honourable in debate as in battle;
      but we are sure, that it is a very difficult task for persons trained in
      the old school of logical tactics to contend with antagonists who possess
      such a quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The species of argument in which the members of the Opposition appear
      chiefly to excel, is that of which the Marquis, in the <i>Critique de
      l&rsquo;Ecole des Femmes</i>, showed himself so great a master:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarte, à la creme&mdash;morbleu, tarte à la creme!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hé bien, que veux tu dire, tarte à la erême?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu, tarte à la crème, chevalier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mais encore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarte à la crème!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dî-nous un peu tes raisons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarte à la crème!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mais il faut expliquer ta pensée, ce me semble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarte à la crème, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Que trouvez-vouz là à redire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moi, rien;&mdash;tarte à la crème!&rdquo; With equal taste and judgment, the
      writers and speakers of the Opposition repeat their favourite phrases,&mdash;&ldquo;deserted
      principles,&rdquo; &ldquo;unnatural coalition,&rdquo; &ldquo;base love of office.&rdquo; They have not,
      we must allow, been unfortunate in their choice of a topic. The English
      are but too much accustomed to consider every public virtue as comprised
      in consistency; and <span class="pagenum">409</span><a name="link409"
       id="link409"></a>the name of coalition has to many ears a startling and
      ominous sound. Of all the charges brought, against the Ministry, this
      alone, as far as we can discover, has any meaning; and even to this we can
      allow no force.
    </p>
    <p>
      To condemn coalitions in the abstract, is manifestly absurd: Since in a
      popular government, no good can be done without concert, and no concert
      can be obtained without compromise. Those who will not stoop to
      compliances which the condition of human nature renders necessary, are
      fitter to be hermits than to be statesmen. Their virtue, like gold which
      is too refined to be coined, must be alloyed before it can be of any use
      in the commerce of society. But most peculiarly inconsistent and
      unreasonable is the conduct of those who, while they profess strong
      Party-feelings, yet entertain a superstitious aversion to Coalitions.
      Every argument which can be urged against coalitions, as such, is also an
      argument against party connexions. Every argument by which party
      connexions can be defended, is a defence of coalitions. What coalitions
      are to parties, parties are to individuals. The members of a party, in
      order to promote some great common object, consent to wave all subordinate
      considerations:&mdash;That they may co-operate with more effect where they
      agree, they contrive, by reciprocal concessions, to preserve the semblance
      of unanimity, even where they differ. Men are not thought unprincipled for
      acting thus; because it is evident that without such mutual sacrifices of
      individual opinions, no government can be formed, nor any important
      measures carried, in a world of which the inhabitants resemble each other
      so little, and depend on each other so much,&mdash;in which there are as
      many varieties of mind as of countenance, yet in which great effects can
      be produced only by combined exertions. We must extend the same indulgence
      to a coalition between parties. If they agree on every important practical
      question, if they differ only about objects which are either insignificant
      or unattainable, no party man can, on his own principles, blame them for
      uniting. These doctrines, like all other doctrines, may be pushed to
      extremes by the injudicious, or employed by the designing as a pretext for
      profligacy. But that they are not in themselves unreasonable or
      pernicious, the whole history of our country proves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Revolution itself was the fruit of a coalition between parties, <span
      class="pagenum">410</span><a name="link410" id="link410"></a>which had
      attacked each other with a fury unknown in later times. In the preceding
      generation their hostility had covered England with blood and mourning.
      They had subsequently exchanged the sword for the axe: But their enmity
      was not the less deadly because it was disguised by the forms of justice.
      By popular clamour, by infamous testimony, by perverted law, they had shed
      innocent and noble blood like water. Yet all their animosities were
      forgotten in the sense of their common danger. Whigs and Tories signed the
      same associations. Bishops and field-preachers thundered out the same
      exhortations. The doctors of Oxford and the goldsmiths of London sent in
      their plate with equal zeal. The administration which, in the reign of
      Queen Anne, defended Holland, rescued Germany, conquered Flanders,
      dismembered the monarchy of Spain, shook the throne of France, vindicated
      the independence of Europe, and established the empire of the sea, was
      formed by a junction between men who had many political contests and many
      personal injuries to forget. Somers had been a member of the ministry
      which had sent Marlborough to the Tower. Marlborough had assisted in
      harassing Somers by a vexatious impeachment. But would these great men
      have acted wisely or honourably if, on such grounds, they had refused to
      serve their country in concert? The Cabinet which conducted the seven
      years&rsquo; war with such distinguished ability and success, was composed of
      members who had a short time before been leaders of opposite parties. The
      Union between Fox and North is, we own, condemned by that argument which
      it will never be possible to answer in a manner satisfactory to the great
      body of mankind,&mdash;the argument from the event. But we should feel
      some surprise at the dislike which some zealous Pittites affect to
      entertain for coalitions, did we not know that a Pittite means, in the
      phraseology of the present day, a person who differs from Mr. Pitt on
      every subject of importance. There are, indeed, two Pitts,&mdash;the real
      and the imaginary,&mdash;the Pitt of history, a Parliamentary reformer, an
      enemy of the Test and Corporation Acts, an advocate of Catholic
      Emancipation and of free trade,&mdash;and the canonized Pitt of the
      legend,&mdash;as unlike to his namesake as Virgil the magician to Virgil
      the poet, or St. James the slayer of Moors to St. James the fisherman.
      What may have been the opinions of that unreal being whose birthday <span
      class="pagenum">411</span><a name="link411" id="link411"></a>is celebrated
      by libations to Protestant Ascendency, on the subject, of coalitions, we
      leave it to his veracious hagiographers, Lord Eldon and Lord Westmoreland,
      to determine. The sentiments of the real Mr. Pitt may be easily
      ascertained from his conduct. At the time of the revolutionary war he
      admitted to participation in his power those who had formerly been his
      most determined enemies. In 1804 he connected himself with Mr. Fox, and,
      on his return to office, attempted to procure a high situation in the
      government for his new ally. One more instance we will mention, which has
      little weight with us, but which ought to have much weight with our
      opponents. They talk of Mr. Pitt;&mdash;but the real object of their
      adoration is unquestionably the late Mr. Percival, a gentleman whose
      acknowledged private virtues were but a poor compensation to his country
      for the narrowness and feebleness of his policy. In 1809 that minister
      offered to serve, not only <i>with</i> Lord Grenville and Earl Grey, but
      even <i>under</i> them. No approximation of feeling between the members of
      the government and their opponents had then taken place: there had not
      even been the slightest remission of hostilities. On no question of
      foreign or domestic policy were the two parties agreed. Yet under such
      circumstances was this proposition made. It was, as might have been
      anticipated, rejected by the Whigs and derided by the country. But the
      recollection of it ought certainly to prevent those who concurred in it,
      and their devoted followers, from talking of the baseness and selfishness
      of coalitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      These general reasonings, it may be said, are superfluous. It is not to
      coalitions in the abstract, but to the present coalition in particular,
      that objection is made. We answer, that an attack on the present coalition
      can only be maintained by succeeding in the most signal way in an attack
      on coalitions in the abstract. For never has the world seen, and never is
      it likely to see, a junction between parties agreeing on so many points,
      and differing on so few. The Whigs and the supporters of Mr. Canning were
      united in principle. They were separated only by names, by badges, and by
      recollections. Opposition, on such grounds as these, would have been
      disgraceful to English statesmen. It would have been as unreasonable and
      as profligate as the disputes of the blue and green factions in the
      Hippodrome of Constantinople. <span class="pagenum">412</span><a
      name="link412" id="link412"></a>One man admires Mr. Pitt, and another Mr.
      Fox. Are they therefore never to act together? Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox were
      themselves willing to coalesce while they were alive; and it would
      therefore be strange, if, after they have been lying for twenty years in
      Westminster Abbey, their names should keep parties asunder. One man
      approves of the revolutionary war. Another thinks it unjust and impolitic.
      But the war is over. It is now merely a matter of historical controversy.
      And the statesman who should require his colleagues to adopt his
      confession of faith respecting it, would act as madly as Don Quixote when
      he went to blows with Cardenio about the chastity of Queen Madasima. On
      these points, and on many such points as these, our new Ministers, no
      doubt, hold different opinions. They may also, for aught we know, hold
      different opinions about the title of Perkin Warbeck, and the genuineness
      of the [Greek] But we shall hardly, on such grounds as these, pronounce
      their union a sacrifice of principle to place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, in short, of very little importance whether the parties which have
      lately united entertain the same sentiments respecting things which have
      been done and cannot be undone. It is of as little importance whether they
      have adopted the same speculative notions on questions which could not at
      present be brought forward with the slightest chance of success, and
      which, in all probability, they will never be required to discuss. The
      real questions are these: Do they differ as to the policy which present
      circumstances require? Or is any great cause, which they may have
      heretofore espoused, placed in a more unfavourable situation by their
      junction?
    </p>
    <p>
      That this is the ease, no person has even attempted to prove. Bold
      assertions have indeed been made by a class of writers, who seem to think
      that their readers are as completely destitute of memory as they
      themselves are of shame. For the last two years they have been abusing Mr.
      Canning for adopting the principles of the Whigs; and they now claim that,
      in joining Mr. Canning, the Whigs have abandoned all their principles!
      &ldquo;The Whigs,&rdquo; said one of their writers, but a few months ago, &ldquo;are
      exercising more real power by means of the present Ministers than if they
      were themselves in office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ministers,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;are no longer Tories. What they call
      conciliation is mere Whiggism.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">413</span><a
      name="link413" id="link413"></a>A third observed that the jest of Mr.
      Canning about Dennis and his thunder had lost all its point, and that it
      was a lamentable truth, that all the late measures of the government
      seemed to have been dictated by the Whigs. Yet these very authors have now
      the effrontery to assert that the Whigs could not possibly support Mr.
      Canning without renouncing every opinion which they had formerly
      professed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We confidently affirm, on the other hand, that no principle whatever has
      been sacrificed. With respect to our foreign relations and our commercial
      policy, the two parties have for years been perfectly agreed. On the
      Catholic question the views of the Whigs are the same with those of a
      great majority of their new colleagues. It is true that, in an illustrious
      assembly, which was formerly suspected of great dulness and great decorum,
      and which has of late effectually redeemed itself from one half of the
      reproach, the conduct of the Whigs towards the Catholics has been
      represented in a very unfavourable light. The arguments employed against
      them belong, we suppose, to a kind of logic which the privileged orders
      alone are qualified to use, and which, with their other constitutional
      distinctions, we earnestly pray that they may long keep to themselves. An
      ingenious member of this assembly is said to have observed, that the
      Protestant alarmists were bound to oppose the new Ministers as friends to
      the Catholic cause, and that the Catholics ought to oppose them as
      traitors to the same cause. He reminded the former of the infinite danger
      of trusting power to a Cabinet composed principally of persons favourable
      to emancipation: and, at the same time, pointed the indignation of the
      latter against the perfidy of the pretended friends who had not stipulated
      that emancipation should be made a ministerial measure! We cannot
      sufficiently admire the exquisite dexterity of an assailant who, in the
      same breath, blames the same people for doing, and for <i>not</i> doing
      the same thing. To ordinary plebeian understandings we should think it
      undeniable that the Catholic question must be now&mdash;either in the same
      situation in which it was before the late change; or it must have lost; or
      it must have gained. If it have gained, the Whigs are justified; if it
      have lost, the enemies of the claims ought zealously to support the new
      government; if it be exactly where it was before, no person who acted with
      Lord Liverpool can, on this ground, consistently oppose Mr. Canning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <span class="pagenum">414</span><a name="link414" id="link414"></a>this
      view, indeed, the cause of the Whigs is the cause of the ministers who
      have seceded from the Cabinet. Both parties have put in the same plea; and
      both must be acquitted or condemned together. If it be allowed that the
      elevation of Mr. Canning was not an event favourable to the Catholic
      cause, the Whigs will certainly stand convicted of inconsistency. But at
      the same time, the only argument by which the ex-Ministers have attempted
      to vindicate their secession, must fall to the ground; and it will be
      difficult to consider that proceeding in any other light than as a
      factious expedient to which they have resorted, in order to embarrass a
      colleague whom they envied. If, on the other hand, the effect of the late
      change were such, that it became the duty of those who objected to
      Catholic Emancipation, to decline all connexion with the Ministry, it must
      surely have become, at the same time, the duty of the friends of
      Emancipation to support the Ministry. Those who take the one ground, when
      their object is to vindicate the seceders, and the other, when their
      object is to blacken the Whigs, who, in the same speech, do not scruple to
      represent the Catholic cause as triumphant and as hopeless, may, we fear,
      draw down some ridicule on themselves, but will hardly convince the
      country. But why did not the Whigs stipulate that some proposition for the
      relief of the Catholics should be immediately brought forward, and
      supported by the whole influence of the Administration? We answer, simply
      because they could not obtain such conditions, and because, by insisting
      upon them, they would have irreparably injured those whom they meant to
      serve, and have thrown the government into the hands of men who would have
      employed all its power and patronage to support a system which, we do not
      scruple to say, is the shame of England, and the curse of Ireland. By the
      course which they have taken, they have insured to the sister kingdom
      every alleviation which its calamities can receive from the lenient
      administration of an oppressive system. Under their government, it will at
      least be no man&rsquo;s interest to espouse the side of bigotry. Truth will have
      a fair chance against prejudice. And whenever the dislike with which the
      majority of the English people regard the Catholic claims shall have been
      overcome by discussion, no other obstacle will remain to be surmounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends of the Catholics have, indeed, too long kept out <span
      class="pagenum">415</span><a name="link415" id="link415"></a>of sight the
      real difficulty which impedes the progress of all measures for their
      relief. There has been a nervous reluctance&mdash;perhaps a natural
      unwillingness, to approach this subject. Yet it is of the utmost
      importance that it should at last be fully understood. The difficulty, we
      believe, is neither with the King nor with the Cabinet,&mdash;neither with
      the Commons nor with the Lords. It is with the People of England; and not
      with the corrupt, not with the servile, not with the rude and uneducated,
      not with the dissolute and turbulent, but with the great body of the
      middling orders;&mdash;of those who live in comfort, and have received
      some instruction. Of the higher classes, the decided majority is, beyond
      all dispute, with the Catholics. The lower classes care nothing at all
      about the question. It is among those whose influence is generally exerted
      for the most salutary purposes,&mdash;among those from whom liberal
      statesmen have, in general, received the strongest support,&mdash;among
      those who feel the deepest detestation of oppression and corruption, that
      erroneous opinions on this subject are most frequent. A faction with which
      they have no other feeling in common, has, on this question, repeatedly
      made them its tools, and has diverted their attention more than once from
      its own folly and profligacy, by raising the cry of No Popery. They have
      espoused their opinions, not from want of honesty, not from want of sense,
      but simply from want of information and reflection. They think as the most
      enlightened men in England thought seventy or eighty years ago. Pulteney
      and Pelham would no more have given political power to Papists than to
      ourang-outangs. A proposition for mitigating the severity of the penal
      laws would, in their time, have been received with suspicion. The full
      discussion which the subject has since undergone, has produced a great
      change. Among intelligent men in that rank of life from which our
      ministers and the members of our legislature are selected, the feeling in
      favour of concession is strong and general. But, unfortunately, sufficient
      attention has not been paid to a lower, but most influential and
      respectable class. The friends of the Catholic claims, content with
      numbering in their ranks all the most distinguished statesmen of two
      generations, proud of lists of minorities and majorities adorned by every
      name which commands the respect of the country, have not sufficiently
      excited themselves to <span class="pagenum">416</span><a name="link416"
       id="link416"></a>combat popular prejudices. Pamphlets against Emancipation
      are circulated, and no answers appear. Sermons are preached against it,
      and no pains are taken to obliterate the impression. The rector carries a
      petition round to every shop-keeper and every farmer in his parish, talks
      of Smith-field and the inquisition, Bishop Bonner and Judge Jeffries. No
      person takes the trouble to canvass on the other side. At an election, the
      candidate who is favourable to the Catholic claims, is almost always
      content to stand on the defensive, he shrinks from the odium of a bold
      avowal. While his antagonist asserts and reviles, he palliates, evades,
      and distinguishes. he is unwilling to give a pledge: he has not made up
      his mind: he hopes that adequate securities for the Church may be
      obtained: he will wait to see how the Catholic States of South America
      behave themselves! And thus, as fast as he can, he gets away from the
      obnoxious subject, to retrenchment, reform, or negro slavery. If such a
      man succeeds, his vote does not benefit the Catholics half so much as his
      shuffling injures them. How can the people understand the question, when
      those whose business it is to enlighten them, will not state it to them
      plainly? Is it strange that they should dislike a cause of which almost
      all its advocates seem to be ashamed? If, at the late election, all our
      publie men who are favourable to Emancipation had dared to speak out, had
      introduced the subject of their own accord, and discussed it day after
      day, they might have lost a few votes; they might have been compelled to
      face a few dead cats; but they would have put down the prejudice
      effectually. Five or six friends of the claims might have been unseated,
      but the claims would have been carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular aversion to them is an honest aversion; according to the
      measure of knowledge which the people possess, it is a just aversion. It
      has been reasoned down wherever the experiment has been fearlessly tried.
      It may be reasoned down everywhere. The war should be carried on in every
      quarter. No misrepresentation should be suffered to pass unrefuted. When a
      silly letter from Philo-Melancthon, or Anti-Doyle, about the Coronation
      Oath, or divided allegiance, makes its appearance in the corner of a
      provincial newspaper, it will not do merely to say, &ldquo;What stuff!&rdquo; We must
      remember that such statements constantly reiterated, and seldom answered,
      will assuredly be believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plain, <span class="pagenum">417</span><a name="link417" id="link417"></a>spirited,
      moderate treatises on the subject, should find their way into every
      cottage;&mdash;not such rancorous nonsense as that for which the Catholics
      formerly contracted with the fiercest and basest libeller of the age, the
      apostate politician, the fraudulent debtor, the ungrateful friend, whom
      England has twice spewed out to America; whom America, though far from
      squeamish, has twice vomited back to England. They will not, they may be
      assured, serve their cause by pouring forth unmeasured abuse on men whose
      memory is justly dear to the hearts of a great people;&mdash;men mighty
      even in their weaknesses, and wise even in their fanaticism;&mdash;the
      goodly fellowship of our reformers,&mdash;the noble army of our martyrs.
      Their scandal about Queen Elizabeth, and their wood-cuts of the devil
      whispering in the ear of John Fox, will produce nothing but disgust. They
      must conduct the controversy with good sense and good temper, and there
      cannot be the slightest doubt of the issue. But of this they may be fully
      assured, that, while the general feeling of the Nation remains unchanged,
      a Ministry which should stake its existence on the success of their
      claims, would ruin itself, without benefiting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conduct of the Catholics, on the present occasion, deserves the
      highest praise. They have shown that experience has at last taught them to
      know their enemies from their friends. Indeed there are few scenes in this
      tragicomic world of ours more amusing than that which the leaders of the
      Opposition are now performing. The very men who have so long obstructed
      Emancipation,&mdash;-who have stirred up the public feeling in England
      against Emancipation,&mdash;who, in fine, have just resigned their
      offices, because a supporter of Emancipation was placed at the head of the
      government,&mdash;are now weeping over the disappointed hopes of the poor
      Papists, and execrating the perfidious Whigs who have taken office without
      stipulating for their relief! The Catholics are, in the mean time, in the
      highest spirits, congratulating themselves on the success of their old
      friends, and laughing at the condoling visages of their new champions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something not very dissimilar is taking place with respect to
      Parliamentary Reform. The reformers are delighted with the new Ministry.
      Their opponents are trying to convince them that they ought to be
      dissatisfied with it. The Whigs, we suppose, ought to have insisted that
      Reform should <span class="pagenum">418</span><a name="link418"
       id="link418"></a>be made a Ministerial measure. We will not at present
      inquire whether they have, as a body, ever declared any decided opinion on
      the subject. A much shorter answer will suffice, he Reform good or bad, it
      is at present evidently unattainable. No man can, by coming into office,
      or by going out of office, either effect it or prevent it. As we are
      arguing with people who are more influenced by one name than by ten
      reasons, we will remind them of the conduct pursued by Mr. Pitt with
      regard to this question. At the very time when he publicly pledged himself
      to use his whole power &ldquo;<i>as a man and as a minister, honestly and boldly</i>&rdquo;
       to carry a proposition of Parliamentary Reform, he was sitting in the same
      Cabinet with persons decidedly hostile to every measure of the kind. At
      the present juncture, we own that we should think it as absurd in any man
      to decline office for the sake of this object, as it would have been in
      Sir Thomas More to refuse the Great Seal, because he could not introduce
      all the institutions of Utopia into England. The world would be in a
      wretched state indeed, if no person were to accept of power, under a form
      of government which he thinks susceptible of improvement. The effect of
      such scrupulosity would be, that the best and wisest men would always be
      out of place; that all authority would be committed to those who might be
      too stupid or too selfish to see abuses in any system by which they could
      profit, and who, by their follies and vices, would aggravate all the evils
      springing from defective institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But were we to admit the truth of every charge which personal enemies or
      professional slanderers have brought against the present ministers of the
      Crown, were we to admit that they had abandoned their principles, that
      they had betrayed the Catholics and the Reformers, it would still remain
      to be considered, whether we might not change for the worse. We trust in
      God that there is no danger. We think that this country never will, never
      can, be subjected to the rule of a party so weak, so violent, so
      ostentatiously selfish, as that which is now in Opposition. Has the
      Cabinet been formed by a coalition? How, let us ask, has the Opposition
      been formed? Is it not composed of men who have, all their lives, been
      thwarting and abusing each other, Jacobins, Whigs, Tories, friends of
      Catholic Emancipation, enemies of Catholic Emancipation,&mdash;men united
      only by their common <span class="pagenum">419</span><a name="link419"
       id="link419"></a>love of high rents, by their common envy of superior
      abilities, by their common wish to depress the people and to dictate to
      the throne? Did Lord Lansdowne at any time differ so widely from Mr.
      Canning as Lord Redesdale from Lord Lauderdale&mdash;sometime
      needle-maker, and candidate for the shrievalty of London? Are the
      Ministers charged with deserting their opinions? and can we find no
      instances of miraculous conversion on the left of the woolsack? What was
      the influence which transformed the <i>Friend of the People</i> into an
      aristocrat, &ldquo;resolved to stand or fall with his order?&rdquo; Whence was the
      sudden illumination, which at once disclosed to all the discarded
      Ministers the imperfections of the Corn Bill? Let us suppose that the
      Whigs had, as a party, brought forward some great measure before the late
      changes, that they had carried it through the Commons, that they had sent
      it up, with the fairest prospect of success, to the Lords, and that they
      had then, in order to gratify Mr. Canning, consented, in the face of all
      their previous declarations, to defeat it, what a tempest of execration
      and derision would have burst upon them! Yet the conduct of the
      ex-Ministers, according to the best lights we can obtain upon it, was even
      more culpable than this. Not content with doing a bad thing, they did it
      in the worst way. The bill which had been prepared by the leader for whom
      they professed boundless veneration, which had been brought in under their
      own sanction, which, as they positively declared, had received their
      fullest consideration, which one of themselves had undertaken to conduct
      through the House of Lords, that very bill they contrived to defeat:&mdash;and,
      in the act of defeating it, they attempted to lay upon the colleagues whom
      they had deserted, the burden of public resentment which they alone had
      incurred. We would speak with indulgence of men who had done their country
      noble service before&mdash;and of many of whom, individually, it must be
      impossible to think otherwise than with respect. But the scene lately
      passed in that great assembly has afflicted and disgusted the country at
      large; and it is not the least of its evil consequences, that it has
      lessened in the public estimation, not only a body which ought always to
      be looked up to with respect, but many individuals of whose motives we
      cannot bring ourselves to judge unfavourably, and from whose high
      qualities we trust the country may yet receive <span class="pagenum">420</span><a
      name="link420" id="link420"></a>both benefit and honour. Mr. Peel
      fortunately did not expose himself quite as effectually as his associates;
      though we regret that the tone he adopted was so undecided and equivocal.
      It was not for him to pronounce any judgment on the wisdom of their
      conduct. He was fully convinced of the purity of their motives. And
      finally it was the eighteenth of June!&mdash;a day on which, it seems, the
      Duke of Wellington is privileged to commit all sorts of mischief with
      impunity to the end of his life. The Duke of Wellington, however, though
      the part which he took was unfortunately prominent, seems to have been
      comparatively innocent. He might not, while in office, have paid much
      attention to the measure in its original form. He might not have
      understood the real nature of his own unlucky amendment. But what were the
      motives of Earl Bathurst? Or where were they when he undertook the care of
      the bill in its former shape? Nothing had been changed since, excepting
      his own situation. And it would be the very madness of charity to believe,
      that, if he had still been a colleague of Lord Liverpool, or had been able
      to come to terms with Mr. Canning, he would have pursued such a line of
      conduct. Culpably as all his coadjutors have acted in this transaction,
      his share of it is the most indefensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is for these men,&mdash;for men who, before they have been two
      months out of office, have retracted the declarations which they made on a
      most important subject just before they quitted office,&mdash;that we are
      to discard the present ministers as inconsistent and unprincipled! And
      these men are the idols of those who entertain so virtuous a loathing for
      unnatural coalitions, and base compromises. These men think themselves
      entitled to boast of the purity of their public virtues, and to repel,
      with indignant amazement, any imputation of interested or factious
      motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dwell long on this event; because it is one which enables the country
      to estimate correctly the practical principles of those who, if the
      present ministers should fall, will assuredly take their places. To call
      their conduct merely factious, is to deal with it far too mildly. It has
      been factious at the expense of consistency, and of all concern for the
      wishes and interests of the people. Was there no other mode of
      embarrassing the government? Could no other opportunity be found or made
      for a division? Was there no other <span class="pagenum">421</span><a
      name="link421" id="link421"></a>pledge which could be violated, if not
      with less awkwardness to themselves, at least with less injury to the
      state? Was it necessary that they should make a handle of a question on
      which the passions of the people were roused to the highest point, and on
      which its daily bread might depend, that they should condemn the country
      to another year of agitation, and expose it to dangers, which, only a few
      months before, they had themselves thought it necessary to avert, by
      advising an extraordinary exercise of the prerogative? There is one
      explanation, and only one. They were out, and they longed to be in.
      Decency, consistency, the prosperity and peace of the country, were as
      dust in the balance. They knew this question had divided men who were
      generally united, and united others who were usually opposed; and though
      they themselves had already taken their part with their colleagues in
      office and the more intelligent part of their habitual opponents, they did
      not scruple, for the sake of embarrassing those they had deserted, to
      purchase the appearance of a numerous following, by opposing a measure
      which they had themselves concocted, and pledged themselves to support.
      From the expedients to which they have resorted in Opposition, we may
      judge of what we have to expect if they should ever return to office.
    </p>
    <p>
      They will return too, it must be remembered, not, as before, the
      colleagues of men by whose superior talents they were overawed, and to
      whose beneficial measures they were often compelled to yield a reluctant
      consent. The late change has separated the greater part of them from all
      such associates forever: it has divided the light from the darkness: it
      has set all the wisdom, all the liberality, all the public spirit on one
      side; the imbecility, the bigotry, and the rashness on the other. If they
      rule again, they will rule alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They will return to situations which they will owe neither to their
      talents nor to their virtues, neither to the choice of their King nor to
      the love of their country; but solely to the support of an Oligarchical
      Faction, richly endowed with every quality which ensures to its possessors
      the hatred of a nation,&mdash;a faction arbitrary, bigoted, and insolent,&mdash;a
      faction which makes parade of its contempt for the dearest interests of
      mankind, which loves to make the people feel of how little weight, in its
      deliberations, is the consideration of their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On <span class="pagenum">422</span><a name="link422" id="link422"></a>this
      party, and on this alone, must such ministers, returning from such a
      secession, rely to uphold them against the public opinion, against the
      wishes of a King who has wisely and nobly performed his duty to the state,
      against the most beloved and respected portion of the aristocracy, against
      a formidable union of all the great statesmen and orators of the age. It
      was believed by those of whose wisdom Lord Eldon and the Duke of Newcastle
      think with reverence, that, in the bond between a sorcerer and his
      familiar demon, there was a stipulation that the gifts bestowed by the
      Powers of Evil should never be employed but for purposes of evil.
      Omnipotent for mischief, these obligors of the fiend were powerless for
      good. Such will be the compact between the Ex-Ministers, if ever they
      should return to power, and the only party which can then support them.
      That they may be masters, they must be slaves. They will be able to stand
      only by abject submission and by boundless profusion&mdash;by giving up
      the People to be oppressed, first for the profit of the Great, and then
      for their amusement,&mdash;by corn-laws, and game-laws, and pensions for
      Lord Robert, and places for Lord John.
    </p>
    <p>
      They will return pledged to oppose every reform, to maintain a constant
      struggle against the spirit of the age, to defend abuses to which the
      nation is every day becoming more quick-sighted. Even Mr. Peel, if,
      unluckily, he should at last identity himself with their faction, must
      restrain his propensity to innovation. Mutterings have already been heard
      in high places against his tendencies to liberality; and all his schemes
      for the reformation of our code or our courts must be abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then will come all those desperate and cruel expedients of which none but
      bad governments stand in need. The press is troublesome. There must be
      fresh laws against the press. Secret societies are formed. The Habeas
      Corpus act must be suspended. The people are distressed and tumultuous.
      They must be kept down by force. The army must be increased; and the taxes
      must be increased. Then the distress and tumult are increased: and then
      the army must be increased again! The country will be governed as a child
      is governed by an ill-tempered nurse,&mdash;first beaten till it cries,
      and then beaten because it cries!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our firm conviction is, that if the seceders return to office, they will
      act thus; and that they will not have the power, even <span class="pagenum">423</span><a
      name="link423" id="link423"></a>if they should have the inclination, to
      act otherwise. And what must the end of these things be? We answer,
      without hesitation, that, if this course be persisted in, if these
      counsels and these counsellors are maintained, the end must be, a
      revolution, a bloody and unsparing revolution&mdash;a revolution which
      will make the ears of those who hear of it tingle in the remotest
      countries, and in the remotest times. The middling orders in England are,
      we well know, attached to the institutions of their country, but not with
      a blindly partial attachment. They see the merits of the system; but they
      also see its faults; and they have a strong and growing desire that these
      faults should be removed. If, while their wish for improvement is becoming
      stronger and stronger, the government is to become worse and worse, the
      consequences are obvious. Even now, it is impossible to disguise, that
      there is arising in the bosom of that class a Republican sect, as
      audacious, as paradoxical, as little inclined to respect antiquity, as
      enthusiastically attached to its ends, as unscrupulous in the choice of
      its means, as the French Jacobins themselves,&mdash;but far superior to
      the French Jacobins in acuteness and information&mdash;in caution, in
      patience, and in resolution. They are men whose minds have been put into
      training for violent exertion. All that is merely ornamental&mdash;? all
      that gives the roundness, the smoothness, and the bloom, has been exuded.
      Nothing is left but nerve, and muscle, and bone. Their love of liberty is
      no boyish fancy. It is not nourished by rhetoric, and it does not
      evaporate in rhetoric. They care nothing for Leonidas, and Epaminondas,
      and Brutus, and Codes. They profess to derive their opinions from
      demonstration alone; and are never so little satisfied with them as when
      they see them exhibited in a romantic form. Metaphysical and political
      science engage their whole attention. Philosophical pride has done for
      them what spiritual pride did for the Puritans in a former age; it has
      generated in them an aversion for the fine arts, for elegant literature,
      and for the sentiments of chivalry. It has made them arrogant, intolerant,
      and impatient of all superiority. These qualities will, in spite of their
      real claims to respect, render them unpopular, as long as the people are
      satisfied with their rulers. But under an ignorant and tyrannical
      ministry, obstinately opposed to the most moderate and judicious
      innovations, their principles would spread as rapidly <span class="pagenum">424</span><a
      name="link424" id="link424"></a>as those of the Puritans formerly spread,
      in spite of their offensive peculiarities. The public, disgusted with the
      blind adherence of its rulers to ancient abuses, would be reconciled to
      the most startling novelties. A strong democratic party would be formed in
      the educated class. In the lowest, and the most numerous order of the
      population, those who have any opinions at all are democrats already. In
      our manufacturing towns, the feeling is even now formidably strong; and it
      is not strange that it should be so: For it is on persons in this station
      that the abuses of our system press most heavily; while its advantages, on
      the other hand, are comparatively little felt by them. An abundant supply
      of the necessaries of life is, with them, almost the only consideration.
      The difference between an arbitrary and a limited monarchy vanishes, when
      compared with the difference between one meal a-day and three meals a-day.
      It is poor consolation to a man who has had no breakfast, and expects no
      supper, that the King does not possess a dispensing power, and that troops
      cannot be raised in time of peace, without the consent of Parliament. With
      this class, our government, free as it is, is even now as unpopular as if
      it were despotic,&mdash;nay, much more so. In despotic states, the
      multitude is unaccustomed to general speculations on politics. Even when
      men suffer most severely, they look no further than the proximate cause.
      They demand the abolition of a particular duty, or tear an obnoxious
      individual to pieces. But they never think of attacking the whole system.
      If Constantinople were in the state in which Manchester and Leeds have
      lately been, there would be a cry against the Grand Vizier or the bakers.
      The head of the Vizier would be thrown to the mob, over the wall of the
      Seraglio&mdash;a score of bakers would be smothered in their own ovens;
      and every thing would go on as before. Not a single rioter would think of
      curtailing the prerogatives of the Sultan, or of demanding a
      representative divan. But people familiar with political inquiries carry
      their scrutiny further; and, justly or unjustly, attribute the grievances
      under which they labour, to defects in the original constitution of the
      government. Thus it is with a large portion of our spinners, our grinders,
      and our weavers. It is not too much to say, that in a season of distress,
      they are ripe for any revolution. This, indeed, is acknowledged by all the
      Tory writers of our time. But all <span class="pagenum">425</span><a
      name="link425" id="link425"></a>this, they tell us, comes of education&mdash;it
      is all the fault of the Liberals. We will not take up the time of our
      readers with answering such observations. We will only remind our gentry
      and clergy, that the question at present is not about the <i>cause</i> of
      the evil, but about its <i>cure</i>; and that, unless due precaution be
      used, let the fault be whose it may, the punishment will inevitably be
      their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of our country, since the peace of 1815, is almost entirely
      made up of the struggles of the lower orders against the government, and
      of the efforts of the government to keep them down. In 1816, immense
      assemblies were convened, secret societies were formed, and gross outrages
      were committed. In 1817, the Habeas Corpus Act was twice suspended. In
      1819, the disturbances broke out afresh. Meetings were held, so
      formidable, from their numbers and their spirit, that the Ministry, and
      the Parliament, approved of the conduct of magistrates who had dispersed
      one of them by the sword. Fresh laws were passed against seditious
      writings and practices. Yet the following year commenced with a desperate
      and extended conspiracy for the assassination of the cabinet, and the
      subversion of the government. A few months after this event, the Queen
      landed. On that occasion, the majority of the middling orders joined with
      the mob. The effect of the union was irresistible. The Ministers and the
      Parliament stood aghast; the bill of pains and penalties was dropped; and
      a convulsion, which seemed inevitable, was averted. But the events of that
      year ought to impress one lesson on the mind of every public man,&mdash;that
      an alliance between the disaffected multitude and a large portion of the
      middling orders, is one with which no government can venture to cope,
      without imminent danger to the constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      A government like that with which England would be cursed, if the present
      Ministry should fall before the present Opposition, would render such an
      alliance not only inevitable, but permanent. In less than ten years, it
      would goad every Reformer in the country into a Revolutionist. It would
      place at the head of the multitude, persons possessing all the education,
      all the judgment, and all the habits of cooperation in which the multitude
      itself is deficient. That great body is physically the most powerful in
      the state. Like the Hebrew champion, it is yet held in captivity by its
      blindness. <span class="pagenum">426</span><a name="link426" id="link426"></a>But
      if once the eyeless Giant shall find a guide to put his hand on the props
      of the State&mdash;if once he shall bow himself upon the pillars, woe to
      all those who have made him their laughing-stock, or chained him to grind
      at their mill!
    </p>
    <p>
      We do, therefore, firmly believe, that, even if no external cause were to
      precipitate a fatal crisis, this country could not be governed for a
      single generation by such men as Lord Westmoreland and Lord Eldon, without
      extreme risk of revolution. But there are other symptoms in the body
      politic, not less alarming than those which we have described. In Ireland,
      there are several millions of Catholics, who do not love our government;
      and who detest, with all their heart, with all their soul, with all their
      mind, and with all their strength, the party now in Opposition. The
      accession of that party to power, would be a death-blow to their hopes of
      obtaining their demands by constitutional means: and we may fairly expect,
      that all the events which followed the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam, will
      take place again, on a greater and more formidable scale. One thing,
      indeed, we have no right to expect, that a second Hoche will be as
      unfortunate as the former. A civil war in Ireland will lead almost
      necessarily to a war with France. Maritime hostilities with France, and
      the clash of neutral and belligerent pretensions, will then produce war
      with America. Then come expeditions to Canada and expeditions to Java. The
      Cape of Good Hope must be garrisoned. Lisbon must be defended. Let us
      suppose the best. That best must be, a long conflict, a dear-bought
      victory, a great addition to a debt already most burdensome, fresh taxes,
      and fresh discontents. All these are events which may not improbably
      happen under any government&mdash;events which the next month may bring
      forth&mdash;events, against which no minister, however able and honest,
      can with perfect certainty provide,&mdash;but which Ministers, whose
      policy should exasperate the people of Ireland, would almost unavoidably
      bring upon us. A Cabinet formed by the Ex-Ministers could scarcely exist
      for a year, without incensing the lower classes of the English to frenzy,
      by giving them up to the selfish tyranny of its aristocratical supporters,
      without driving Ireland into rebellion, and without tempting France to
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one hope, and one hope only for our country; and <span
      class="pagenum">427</span><a name="link427" id="link427"></a>that hope is
      in a liberal Administration,&mdash;in Administration which will follow
      with cautions, but with constantly advancing steps, the progress of the
      public mind; which, by promptitude to redress practical grievances, will
      enable itself to oppose with authority and effect, the propositions of
      turbulent theorists; which by kindness and fairness in all its dealings
      with the People, will entitle itself to their confidence and esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of England at the present moment, bears a close resemblance to
      that of France at the time when Turgot was called to the head of affairs.
      Abuses were numerous; public burdens heavy; a spirit of innovation was
      abroad among the people. The philosophical Minister attempted to secure
      the ancient institutions, by amending them. The mild reforms which he
      projected, had they been carried into execution, would have conciliated
      the people, and saved from the most tremendous of all commotions the
      Church, the Aristocracy, and the Throne. But a crowd of narrow-minded
      nobles, ignorant of their own interest, though solicitous for nothing
      else, the Newcastles and the Salisburys of France, began to tremble for
      their oppressive franchises. Their clamours overpowered the mild good
      sense of a King who wanted only firmness to be the best of Sovereigns. The
      Minister was discarded for councillors more obsequious to the privileged
      orders; and the aristocracy and clergy exulted in their success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a new period of profusion and misrule. And then, swiftly, like
      an armed man, came poverty and dismay. The acclamation of the nobles, and
      the <i>Te Deums</i> of the church, grew fainter and fainter. The very
      courtiers muttered disapprobation. The Ministers stammered out feeble and
      inconsistent counsels. But all other voices were soon drowned in one,
      which every moment waxed louder and more terrible,&mdash;in the fierce and
      tumultuous roar of a great people, conscious of irresistible strength,
      maddened by intolerable wrongs, and sick of deferred hopes! That cry, so
      long stifled, now rose from every corner of France, made itself heard in
      the presence-chamber of her King, in the salons of her nobles, and in the
      refectories of her luxurious priesthood. Then, at length, concessions were
      made which the subjects of Louis the Fourteenth would have thought it
      impious even to desire,&mdash;which the most factious opponent of <span
      class="pagenum">428</span><a name="link428" id="link428"></a>Louis the
      Fifteenth had never ventured to ask,&mdash;which, but a few years before,
      would have been received with ecstasies of gratitude. But it was too late!
    </p>
    <p>
      The imprisoned Genie of the Arabian Tales, during the early period of his
      confinement, promised wealth, empire, and supernatural powers to the man
      who should extricate him. But when he had waited long in vain, mad with
      rage at the continuance of his captivity, he vowed to destroy his
      deliverer without mercy! Such is the gratitude of nations exasperated by
      misgovernment to rulers who are slow to concede. The first use which they
      make of freedom is to avenge themselves on those who have been so slow to
      grant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was this disposition more remarkably displayed than at the period of
      which we speak. Abuses were swept away with unsparing severity. The royal
      prerogatives, the feudal privileges, the provincial distinctions, were
      sacrificed to the passions of the people. Every thing was given; and every
      thing was given in vain. Distrust and hatred were not to be thus
      eradicated from the minds of men who thought that they were not receiving
      favours but extorting rights; and that, if they deserved blame, it was not
      for their insensibility to tardy benefits, but for their forgetfulness of
      past oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      What followed was the necessary consequence of such a state of feeling.
      The recollection of old grievances made the people suspicious and cruel.
      The fear of popular outrages produced emigrations, intrigues with foreign
      courts; and, finally, a. general war. Then came the barbarity of fear; the
      triple despotism of the clubs, the committees, and the commune; the
      organized anarchy, the fanatical atheism, the scheming and far-sighted
      madness, the butcheries of the Châtelet, and the accursed marriages of the
      Loire. The whole property of the nation changed hands. Its best and wisest
      citizens were banished or murdered. Dungeons were emptied by assassins as
      fast as they were filled by spies. Provinces were made desolate. Towns
      were unpeopled. Old things passed away. All things became new.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paroxysm terminated. A singular train of events restored the house of
      Bourbon to the French throne. The exiles have returned. But they have
      returned as the few survivors of the deluge returned to a world in which
      they could <span class="pagenum">429</span><a name="link429" id="link429"></a>recognise
      nothing; in which the valleys had been raised, and the mountains
      depressed, and the courses of the rivers changed,&mdash;in which sand and
      sea-weed had covered the cultivated fields and the walls of imperial
      cities. They have returned to seek in vain, amidst the mouldering relics
      of a former system, and the fermenting elements of a new creation, the
      traces of any remembered object. The old boundaries are obliterated. The
      old laws are forgotten. The old titles have become laughing-stocks. The
      gravity of the parliaments, and the pomp of the hierarchy; the Doctors
      whose disputes agitated the Sorbonne, and the embroidered multitude whose
      footsteps wore out the marble pavements of Versailles,&mdash;all have
      disappeared. The proud and voluptuous prelates who feasted on silver, and
      dozed amidst curtains of massy velvet, have been replaced by curates who
      undergo every drudgery and every humiliation for the wages of lackeys. To
      those gay and elegant nobles who studied military science as a fashionable
      accomplishment, and expected military rank as a part of their birthright,
      have succeeded men born in lofts and cellars; educated in the halfnaked
      ranks of the revolutionary armies, and raised by ferocious valour and
      self-taught skill, to dignities with which the coarseness of their manners
      and language forms a grotesque contrast. The government may amuse itself
      by playing at despotism, by reviving the names and aping the style of the
      old court&mdash;as Helenus in Epirus consoled himself for the lost
      magnificence of Troy, by calling his book Xanthus, and the entrance of his
      little capital the Seæan gate. But the law of entail is gone, and cannot
      be restored. The liberty of the press is established, and the feeble
      struggles of the Minister cannot permanently put it down. The Bastille is
      fallen, and can never more rise from its ruins. A few words, a few
      ceremonies, a few rhetorical topics, make up all that remains of that
      system which was founded so deeply by the policy of the house of Valois,
      and adorned so splendidly by the pride of Louis the Great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this a romance? Or is it a faithful picture of what has lately been in
      a neighbouring land&mdash;of what may shortly be, within the borders of
      our own? Has the warning been given in vain? Have our Mannerses and
      Clintons so soon forgotten the fate of houses as wealthy and as noble as
      their own: Have they forgotten how the tender and delicate woman,&mdash;the
      <span class="pagenum">430</span><a name="link430" id="link430"></a>woman
      who would not set her foot on the earth for tenderness and delicateness,
      the idol of gilded drawing-rooms, the pole-star of crowded theatres, the
      standard of beauty, the arbitress of fashion, the patroness of genius,&mdash;was
      compelled to exchange her luxurious and dignified ease for labour and
      dependence, the sighs of Dukes and the flattery of bowing Abbés for the
      insults of rude pupils and exacting mothers;&mdash;perhaps, even to draw
      an infamous and miserable subsistence from those charms which had been the
      glory of royal circles&mdash;to sell for a morsel of bread her&rsquo; reluctant
      caresses and her haggard smiles&mdash;to be turned over from a garret to a
      hospital, and from a hospital to a parish vault? Have they forgotten how
      the gallant and luxurious nobleman, sprung from illustrious ancestors,
      marked out from his cradle for the highest honours of the State and of the
      army, impatient of all control, exquisitely sensible of the slightest
      affront, with all his high spirit, his polished manners, his voluptuous
      habits, was reduced to request, with tears in his eyes, credit for
      half-a-crown,&mdash;to pass day after day in hearing the auxiliary verbs
      mis-recited, or the first page of Télémaque misconstrued, by petulant
      boys, who infested him with nicknames and caricatures, who mimicked his
      foreign accent, and laughed at his thread-bare coat? Have they forgotten
      all this? God grant that they may never remember it with unavailing
      self-accusation, when desolation shall have visited wealthier cities and
      fairer gardens;&mdash;when Manchester shall be as Lyons, and Stowe as
      Chantilly;&mdash;when he who now, in the pride of rank and opulence,
      sneers at what we have written in the bitter sincerity of our hearts,
      shall be thankful for a porringer of broth at the door of some Spanish
      convent, or shall implore some Italian money-lender to advance another
      pistole on his George!

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
